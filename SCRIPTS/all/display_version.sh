# (A bit changed by op226) Chris's code
## for retrieving SVN version number {{{

#svnversion . | sed 's/.*://' | sed 's/M//' > version.tmp

##svnversion returns 'exported' if you have it installed but run it in a non svn directory.
##If svnversion is not installed at all, the file will be empty. In either case, we want to
##use the version number recorded previously.

#if [ "`cat version.tmp`" != "exported" ] && [ "`cat version.tmp`" != "" ]; then

## If we are working with svn however, 
## we want to overwrite the version number with the current one.

#cp version.tmp VERSION
#fi
##Remove the temporary file
#rm version.tmp
##Return the version from the VERSION file
#cat VERSION
