!   THESE ARE THE CONSTANTS TAKEN FROM PRB 50 5645 (1994)          72ND

      DOUBLE PRECISION CHI,BETA,D,A,B,RC,DELTA,&
     &                 VSSSIG,VSPSIG,VPPSIG,VPPPI,KAPPA,&
     &                 EPSS,EPSP,ALPHA

      PARAMETER (CHI=0.486D0, BETA=4.0D0/1.12D0, D=2.35D0, A=0.08D0,&
     &    B=-1.4D0, RC=3.5D0, DELTA=0.1D0, VSSSIG= -2.37D0, &
     &    VSPSIG=2.52D0, VPPSIG=3.32D0, VPPPI= -1.07D0,&
     &    ALPHA = 1.0D0/1.12D0,KAPPA=1.903D0,&
     &    EPSS=-13.55D0, EPSP=-6.52D0)

!   FIRST THOSE FOR THE REPULSIVE ENERGY TERM
!   CHI IS CHI(0), BETA AND D ARE PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
!   ALTHOUGH BETA=4/R(0), WHERE R(0) IS HALF THE DIMER BOND LENGTH
!   AND D IS THE BOND LENGTH OF A CRYSTAL.

!   THEN IN THE BOND COUNTING TERMS
!   A AND B ARE FITTED PARAMETERS SO THA THE COHESIVE ENERGIES OF
!   SEVERAL CLUSTERS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE CORRESPONDING AB 
!   INITIO VALUES.
!   RC IS NOT A CUTOFF DISTANCE FOR INTERACTION APPARENTLY BUT
!   MERELY A DISTANCE FOR CALIBRATING THE ENERGY TERM.
!   THERE IS NO CUTOFF BETWEEN ATOMS IN THE MENON-SUBBASWAMY SCHEME.

!   VECT(1) IS THE VSSSIG PARAMETER ALLEGEDLY FROM HARRISON'S 
!   UNIVERSAL PARAMETER SCHEME (THESE FIGURES COME FROM 
!   PRB 50 12754 (1993) AND I HAVE ASSUMED THAT THEY ARE AT THE
!   CRYSTAL BOND LENGTH (D=2.35) ALTHOUGH THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE
!   CONSISTENT WITH THE SCHEME IN HARRRISON'T BOOK "ELECTRONIC 
!   STRUCTURE AND THE PROPERTIES IF SOLIDS".
!   SIMILARLY, VECT(2) IS VSPSIG, VECT(3) VPPSIG AND VECT(4) VPPPI.
!   THESE ARE ASSIGNED IN THE MAIN PROGRAM TB.SI.F
!   KAPPA, ZETA AND ALPHA ARE ALL PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY.

!   THE PARAMETER FUNCTION WILL NOT ACCEPT ARRAYS...MOST USEFUL.
