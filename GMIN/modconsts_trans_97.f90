!   THESE ARE THE CONSTANTS TAKEN FROM PRB 15TH APRIL (1997)          
!   THE IMPROVED TRANSFERABLE POTENTIAL OF MENON AND SUBBASWAMY.
!   I HAVE ALSO USED DATA LINES TO FIX THE VALUES OF VECT AND EPS
!   DON'T KNOW HOW THIS AFFECTS SPEED.

      DOUBLE PRECISION CHI,BETA,D,A,B,RC,DELTA,KAPPA,SIGMA,&
     &                 ALPHA,VECT(4),EPS(4),EPSS,EPSP,FUDGE
!     1                 VSSSIG,VSPSIG,VPPSIG,VPPPI

      PARAMETER (CHI=0.41D0, D=2.36D0, A=0.08D0,&
     &    B=-1.4D0, RC=3.5D0, DELTA=0.1D0, SIGMA=2.5D0,&
     &    ALPHA = 1.62D0, KAPPA=1.7D0, BETA=4.0D0*ALPHA,&
     &    EPSS=-13.55D0, EPSP=-6.52D0, FUDGE=1.1D0)
      DATA VECT(1), VECT(2), VECT(3), VECT(4)/ -2.37D0,2.52D0,3.32D0,-1.07D0 /
      DATA EPS(1), EPS(2), EPS(3), EPS(4)/ -27.1D0,-20.07D0,-13.04D0,-13.04D0 /

!   FIRST THOSE FOR THE REPULSIVE ENERGY TERM
!   CHI IS CHI(0), BETA AND D ARE PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY
!   ALTHOUGH BETA WAS =4/R(0), WHERE R(0) IS HALF THE DIMER BOND LENGTH
!   AND D IS THE BOND LENGTH OF A CRYSTAL.
!   HOWEVER, IN THE TRANSFERABLE VERSION OF MENON AND SUBBASWAMY'S POTENTIAL
!   BETA=4*ALPHA

!   SIGMA IS THE NEW PARAMETER INTRODUCED FOR THE IMPROVED 
!   TRANSFERABLE PARAMETER.

!   THEN IN THE BOND COUNTING TERMS
!   A AND B ARE FITTED PARAMETERS SO THA THE COHESIVE ENERGIES OF
!   SEVERAL CLUSTERS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE CORRESPONDING AB 
!   INITIO VALUES.
!   RC IS NOT A CUTOFF DISTANCE FOR INTERACTION APPARENTLY BUT
!   MERELY A DISTANCE FOR CALIBRATING THE ENERGY TERM.
!   THERE IS NO CUTOFF BETWEEN ATOMS IN THE MENON-SUBBASWAMY SCHEME.

!   VECT(1) IS THE VSSSIG PARAMETER ALLEGEDLY FROM HARRISON'S 
!   UNIVERSAL PARAMETER SCHEME (THESE FIGURES COME FROM 
!   PRB 50 12754 (1993) AND I HAVE ASSUMED THAT THEY ARE AT THE
!   CRYSTAL BOND LENGTH (D=2.35) ALTHOUGH THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE
!   CONSISTENT WITH THE SCHEME IN HARRRISON'T BOOK "ELECTRONIC 
!   STRUCTURE AND THE PROPERTIES IF SOLIDS".
!   SIMILARLY, VECT(2) IS VSPSIG, VECT(3) VPPSIG AND VECT(4) VPPPI.
!   THESE ARE ASSIGNED IN THE MAIN PROGRAM SILICON.F
!   KAPPA, ZETA AND ALPHA ARE ALL PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY.

!   THE PARAMETER FUNCTION WILL NOT ACCEPT ARRAYS...MOST USEFUL.
