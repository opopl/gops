C
C                   USE RTOL = 0.0 FOR PURE ABSOLUTE ERROR CONTROL, AND

C
C *DESCRIPTION:
C     DLSODE SOLVES THE INITIAL VALUE PROBLEM FOR STIFF OR NONSTIFF
C     SYSTEMS OF FIRST-ORDER ODE'S,
C
C        DY/DT = F(T,Y) ,
C
C     OR, IN COMPONENT FORM,
C
C        DY(I)/DT = F(I) = F(I,T,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQ))
C                                                  (I = 1, ..., NEQ) .
C
C     DLSODE IS A PACKAGE BASED ON THE GEAR AND GEARB PACKAGES, AND ON
C     THE OCTOBER 23, 1978, VERSION OF THE TENTATIVE ODEPACK USER
C     INTERFACE STANDARD, WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS.
C
C     THE STEPS IN SOLVING SUCH A PROBLEM ARE AS FOLLOWS.
C
C     A. FIRST WRITE A SUBROUTINE OF THE FORM
C
C           SUBROUTINE  F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C           INTEGER  NEQ
C           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C
C        WHICH SUPPLIES THE VECTOR FUNCTION F BY LOADING YDOT(I) WITH
C        F(I).
C
C     B. NEXT DETERMINE (OR GUESS) WHETHER OR NOT THE PROBLEM IS STIFF.
C        STIFFNESS OCCURS WHEN THE JACOBIAN MATRIX DF/DY HAS AN
C        EIGENVALUE WHOSE REAL PART IS NEGATIVE AND LARGE IN MAGNITUDE
C        COMPARED TO THE RECIPROCAL OF THE T SPAN OF INTEREST.  IF THE
C        PROBLEM IS NONSTIFF, USE METHOD FLAG MF = 10.  IF IT IS STIFF,
C        THERE ARE FOUR STANDARD CHOICES FOR MF, AND DLSODE REQUIRES THE
C        JACOBIAN MATRIX IN SOME FORM.  THIS MATRIX IS REGARDED EITHER
C        AS FULL (MF = 21 OR 22), OR BANDED (MF = 24 OR 25).  IN THE
C        BANDED CASE, DLSODE REQUIRES TWO HALF-BANDWIDTH PARAMETERS ML
C        AND MU. THESE ARE, RESPECTIVELY, THE WIDTHS OF THE LOWER AND
C        UPPER PARTS OF THE BAND, EXCLUDING THE MAIN DIAGONAL.  THUS THE
C        BAND CONSISTS OF THE LOCATIONS (I,J) WITH
C
C           I - ML <= J <= I + MU ,
C
C        AND THE FULL BANDWIDTH IS ML + MU + 1 .
C
C     C. IF THE PROBLEM IS STIFF, YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO SUPPLY THE
C        JACOBIAN DIRECTLY (MF = 21 OR 24), BUT IF THIS IS NOT FEASIBLE,
C        DLSODE WILL COMPUTE IT INTERNALLY BY DIFFERENCE QUOTIENTS (MF =
C        22 OR 25).  IF YOU ARE SUPPLYING THE JACOBIAN, WRITE A
C        SUBROUTINE OF THE FORM
C
C           SUBROUTINE  JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C           INTEGER  NEQ, ML, MU, NRWOPD
C           DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C
C        WHICH PROVIDES DF/DY BY LOADING PD AS FOLLOWS:
C        - FOR A FULL JACOBIAN (MF = 21), LOAD PD(I,J) WITH DF(I)/DY(J),
C          THE PARTIAL DERIVATIVE OF F(I) WITH RESPECT TO Y(J).  (IGNORE
C          THE ML AND MU ARGUMENTS IN THIS CASE.)
C        - FOR A BANDED JACOBIAN (MF = 24), LOAD PD(I-J+MU+1,J) WITH
C          DF(I)/DY(J); I.E., LOAD THE DIAGONAL LINES OF DF/DY INTO THE
C          ROWS OF PD FROM THE TOP DOWN.
C        - IN EITHER CASE, ONLY NONZERO ELEMENTS NEED BE LOADED.
C
C     D. WRITE A MAIN PROGRAM THAT CALLS SUBROUTINE DLSODE ONCE FOR EACH
C        POINT AT WHICH ANSWERS ARE DESIRED.  THIS SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE
C        FOR POSSIBLE USE OF LOGICAL UNIT 6 FOR OUTPUT OF ERROR MESSAGES
C        BY DLSODE.
C
C        BEFORE THE FIRST CALL TO DLSODE, SET ISTATE = 1, SET Y AND T TO
C        THE INITIAL VALUES, AND SET TOUT TO THE FIRST OUTPUT POINT.  TO
C        CONTINUE THE INTEGRATION AFTER A SUCCESSFUL RETURN, SIMPLY
C        RESET TOUT AND CALL DLSODE AGAIN.  NO OTHER PARAMETERS NEED BE
C        RESET.
C
C *EXAMPLES:
C     THE FOLLOWING IS A SIMPLE EXAMPLE PROBLEM, WITH THE CODING NEEDED
C     FOR ITS SOLUTION BY DLSODE. THE PROBLEM IS FROM CHEMICAL KINETICS,
C     AND CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING THREE RATE EQUATIONS:
C
C        DY1/DT = -.04*Y1 + 1.E4*Y2*Y3
C        DY2/DT = .04*Y1 - 1.E4*Y2*Y3 - 3.E7*Y2**2
C        DY3/DT = 3.E7*Y2**2
C
C     ON THE INTERVAL FROM T = 0.0 TO T = 4.E10, WITH INITIAL CONDITIONS
C     Y1 = 1.0, Y2 = Y3 = 0. THE PROBLEM IS STIFF.
C
C     THE FOLLOWING CODING SOLVES THIS PROBLEM WITH DLSODE, USING 
C     MF = 21 AND PRINTING RESULTS AT T = .4, 4., ..., 4.E10.  IT USES 
C     ITOL = 2 AND ATOL MUCH SMALLER FOR Y2 THAN FOR Y1 OR Y3 BECAUSE Y2 
C     HAS MUCH SMALLER VALUES.  AT THE END OF THE RUN, STATISTICAL 
C     QUANTITIES OF INTEREST ARE PRINTED.

C
C *ACCURACY:
C     THE ACCURACY OF THE SOLUTION DEPENDS ON THE CHOICE OF TOLERANCES
C     RTOL AND ATOL.  ACTUAL (GLOBAL) ERRORS MAY EXCEED THESE LOCAL
C     TOLERANCES, SO CHOOSE THEM CONSERVATIVELY.
C
C *CAUTIONS:
C     THE WORK ARRAYS SHOULD NOT BE ALTERED BETWEEN CALLS TO DLSODE FOR
C     THE SAME PROBLEM, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR THE CONDITIONAL AND OPTIONAL
C     INPUTS.
C
C *PORTABILITY:
C     SINCE NEQ IS DIMENSIONED INSIDE DLSODE, SOME COMPILERS MAY OBJECT
C     TO A CALL TO DLSODE WITH NEQ A SCALAR VARIABLE.  IN THIS EVENT, 
C     USE DIMENSION NEQ(1).  SIMILAR REMARKS APPLY TO RTOL AND ATOL.
C
C     NOTE TO CRAY USERS:
C     FOR MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY, USE THE CFT77 COMPILER.  APPROPRIATE
C     COMPILER OPTIMIZATION DIRECTIVES HAVE BEEN INSERTED FOR CFT77.

C
C *LONG DESCRIPTION:
C     THE FOLLOWING COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THE USER INTERFACE TO
C     DLSODE CONSISTS OF FOUR PARTS:
C
C     1.  THE CALL SEQUENCE TO SUBROUTINE DLSODE, WHICH IS A DRIVER
C         ROUTINE FOR THE SOLVER.  THIS INCLUDES DESCRIPTIONS OF BOTH
C         THE CALL SEQUENCE ARGUMENTS AND USER-SUPPLIED ROUTINES.
C         FOLLOWING THESE DESCRIPTIONS IS A DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONAL
C         INPUTS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CALL SEQUENCE, AND THEN A
C         DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONAL OUTPUTS IN THE WORK ARRAYS.
C
C     2.  DESCRIPTIONS OF OTHER ROUTINES IN THE DLSODE PACKAGE THAT MAY
C         BE (OPTIONALLY) CALLED BY THE USER.  THESE PROVIDE THE ABILITY
C         TO ALTER ERROR MESSAGE HANDLING, SAVE AND RESTORE THE INTERNAL
C         COMMON, AND OBTAIN SPECIFIED DERIVATIVES OF THE SOLUTION Y(T).
C
C     3.  DESCRIPTIONS OF COMMON BLOCK TO BE DECLARED IN OVERLAY OR
C         SIMILAR ENVIRONMENTS, OR TO BE SAVED WHEN DOING AN INTERRUPT
C         OF THE PROBLEM AND CONTINUED SOLUTION LATER.
C
C     4.  DESCRIPTION OF TWO ROUTINES IN THE DLSODE PACKAGE, EITHER OF
C         WHICH THE USER MAY REPLACE WITH HIS OWN VERSION, IF DESIRED.
C         THESE RELATE TO THE MEASUREMENT OF ERRORS.
C
C
C                         PART 1.  CALL SEQUENCE
C                         ----------------------
C
C     ARGUMENTS
C     ---------
C     THE CALL SEQUENCE PARAMETERS USED FOR INPUT ONLY ARE
C
C        F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, MF,
C
C     AND THOSE USED FOR BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT ARE
C
C        Y, T, ISTATE.
C
C     THE WORK ARRAYS RWORK AND IWORK ARE ALSO USED FOR CONDITIONAL AND
C     OPTIONAL INPUTS AND OPTIONAL OUTPUTS.  (THE TERM OUTPUT HERE
C     REFERS TO THE RETURN FROM SUBROUTINE DLSODE TO THE USER'S CALLING
C     PROGRAM.)
C
C     THE LEGALITY OF INPUT PARAMETERS WILL BE THOROUGHLY CHECKED ON THE
C     INITIAL CALL FOR THE PROBLEM, BUT NOT CHECKED THEREAFTER UNLESS A
C     CHANGE IN INPUT PARAMETERS IS FLAGGED BY ISTATE = 3 ON INPUT.
C
C     THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CALL ARGUMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.
C
C     F        THE NAME OF THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE DEFINING THE ODE
C              SYSTEM.  THE SYSTEM MUST BE PUT IN THE FIRST-ORDER FORM
C              DY/DT = F(T,Y), WHERE F IS A VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTION OF
C              THE SCALAR T AND THE VECTOR Y. SUBROUTINE F IS TO COMPUTE
C              THE FUNCTION F. IT IS TO HAVE THE FORM
C
C                 SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C                 DOUBLE PRECISION  T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C
C              WHERE NEQ, T, AND Y ARE INPUT, AND THE ARRAY YDOT =
C              F(T,Y) IS OUTPUT.  Y AND YDOT ARE ARRAYS OF LENGTH NEQ.
C              SUBROUTINE F SHOULD NOT ALTER Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).  F MUST BE
C              DECLARED EXTERNAL IN THE CALLING PROGRAM.
C
C              SUBROUTINE F MAY ACCESS USER-DEFINED QUANTITIES IN
C              NEQ(2),... AND/OR IN Y(NEQ(1)+1),..., IF NEQ IS AN ARRAY
C              (DIMENSIONED IN F) AND/OR Y HAS LENGTH EXCEEDING NEQ(1).
C              SEE THE DESCRIPTIONS OF NEQ AND Y BELOW.
C
C              IF QUANTITIES COMPUTED IN THE F ROUTINE ARE NEEDED
C              EXTERNALLY TO DLSODE, AN EXTRA CALL TO F SHOULD BE MADE
C              FOR THIS PURPOSE, FOR CONSISTENT AND ACCURATE RESULTS.
C              IF ONLY THE DERIVATIVE DY/DT IS NEEDED, USE DINTDY
C              INSTEAD.
C
C     NEQ      THE SIZE OF THE ODE SYSTEM (NUMBER OF FIRST-ORDER
C              ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS).  USED ONLY FOR INPUT.
C              NEQ MAY BE DECREASED, BUT NOT INCREASED, DURING THE
C              PROBLEM.  IF NEQ IS DECREASED (WITH ISTATE = 3 ON INPUT),
C              THE REMAINING COMPONENTS OF Y SHOULD BE LEFT UNDISTURBED,
C              IF THESE ARE TO BE ACCESSED IN F AND/OR JAC.
C
C              NORMALLY, NEQ IS A SCALAR, AND IT IS GENERALLY REFERRED
C              TO AS A SCALAR IN THIS USER INTERFACE DESCRIPTION.
C              HOWEVER, NEQ MAY BE AN ARRAY, WITH NEQ(1) SET TO THE
C              SYSTEM SIZE.  (THE DLSODE PACKAGE ACCESSES ONLY NEQ(1).)
C              IN EITHER CASE, THIS PARAMETER IS PASSED AS THE NEQ
C              ARGUMENT IN ALL CALLS TO F AND JAC.  HENCE, IF IT IS AN
C              ARRAY, LOCATIONS NEQ(2),... MAY BE USED TO STORE OTHER
C              INTEGER DATA AND PASS IT TO F AND/OR JAC.  SUBROUTINES
C              F AND/OR JAC MUST INCLUDE NEQ IN A DIMENSION STATEMENT
C              IN THAT CASE.
C
C     Y        A REAL ARRAY FOR THE VECTOR OF DEPENDENT VARIABLES, OF
C              LENGTH NEQ OR MORE.  USED FOR BOTH INPUT AND OUTPUT ON
C              THE FIRST CALL (ISTATE = 1), AND ONLY FOR OUTPUT ON
C              OTHER CALLS.  ON THE FIRST CALL, Y MUST CONTAIN THE
C              VECTOR OF INITIAL VALUES.  ON OUTPUT, Y CONTAINS THE
C              COMPUTED SOLUTION VECTOR, EVALUATED AT T. IF DESIRED,
C              THE Y ARRAY MAY BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES BETWEEN
C              CALLS TO THE SOLVER.
C
C              THIS ARRAY IS PASSED AS THE Y ARGUMENT IN ALL CALLS TO F
C              AND JAC.  HENCE ITS LENGTH MAY EXCEED NEQ, AND LOCATIONS
C              Y(NEQ+1),... MAY BE USED TO STORE OTHER REAL DATA AND
C              PASS IT TO F AND/OR JAC.  (THE DLSODE PACKAGE ACCESSES
C              ONLY Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C     T        THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE.  ON INPUT, T IS USED ONLY ON
C              THE FIRST CALL, AS THE INITIAL POINT OF THE INTEGRATION.
C              ON OUTPUT, AFTER EACH CALL, T IS THE VALUE AT WHICH A
C              COMPUTED SOLUTION Y IS EVALUATED (USUALLY THE SAME AS
C              TOUT).  ON AN ERROR RETURN, T IS THE FARTHEST POINT
C              REACHED.
C
C     TOUT     THE NEXT VALUE OF T AT WHICH A COMPUTED SOLUTION IS
C              DESIRED.  USED ONLY FOR INPUT.
C
C              WHEN STARTING THE PROBLEM (ISTATE = 1), TOUT MAY BE EQUAL
C              TO T FOR ONE CALL, THEN SHOULD NOT EQUAL T FOR THE NEXT
C              CALL.  FOR THE INITIAL T, AN INPUT VALUE OF TOUT .NE. T
C              IS USED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF THE
C              INTEGRATION (I.E., THE ALGEBRAIC SIGN OF THE STEP SIZES)
C              AND THE ROUGH SCALE OF THE PROBLEM.  INTEGRATION IN
C              EITHER DIRECTION (FORWARD OR BACKWARD IN T) IS PERMITTED.
C
C              IF ITASK = 2 OR 5 (ONE-STEP MODES), TOUT IS IGNORED
C              AFTER THE FIRST CALL (I.E., THE FIRST CALL WITH
C              TOUT .NE. T).  OTHERWISE, TOUT IS REQUIRED ON EVERY CALL.
C
C              IF ITASK = 1, 3, OR 4, THE VALUES OF TOUT NEED NOT BE
C              MONOTONE, BUT A VALUE OF TOUT WHICH BACKS UP IS LIMITED
C              TO THE CURRENT INTERNAL T INTERVAL, WHOSE ENDPOINTS ARE
C              TCUR - HU AND TCUR.  (SEE "OPTIONAL OUTPUTS" BELOW FOR
C              TCUR AND HU.)
C
C
C     ITOL     AN INDICATOR FOR THE TYPE OF ERROR CONTROL.  SEE
C              DESCRIPTION BELOW UNDER ATOL.  USED ONLY FOR INPUT.
C
C     RTOL     A RELATIVE ERROR TOLERANCE PARAMETER, EITHER A SCALAR OR
C              AN ARRAY OF LENGTH NEQ.  SEE DESCRIPTION BELOW UNDER
C              ATOL.  INPUT ONLY.
C
C     ATOL     AN ABSOLUTE ERROR TOLERANCE PARAMETER, EITHER A SCALAR OR
C              AN ARRAY OF LENGTH NEQ.  INPUT ONLY.
C
C              THE INPUT PARAMETERS ITOL, RTOL, AND ATOL DETERMINE THE
C              ERROR CONTROL PERFORMED BY THE SOLVER.  THE SOLVER WILL
C              CONTROL THE VECTOR E = (E(I)) OF ESTIMATED LOCAL ERRORS
C              IN Y, ACCORDING TO AN INEQUALITY OF THE FORM
C
C                 RMS-NORM OF ( E(I)/EWT(I) ) <= 1,
C
C              WHERE
C
C                 EWT(I) = RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL(I),
C
C              AND THE RMS-NORM (ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE NORM) HERE IS
C
C                 RMS-NORM(V) = SQRT(SUM V(I)**2 / NEQ).
C
C              HERE EWT = (EWT(I)) IS A VECTOR OF WEIGHTS WHICH MUST
C              ALWAYS BE POSITIVE, AND THE VALUES OF RTOL AND ATOL
C              SHOULD ALL BE NONNEGATIVE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE GIVES THE
C              TYPES (SCALAR/ARRAY) OF RTOL AND ATOL, AND THE
C              CORRESPONDING FORM OF EWT(I).
C
C              ITOL    RTOL      ATOL      EWT(I)
C              ----    ------    ------    -----------------------------
C              1       SCALAR    SCALAR    RTOL*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL
C              2       SCALAR    ARRAY     RTOL*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL(I)
C              3       ARRAY     SCALAR    RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL
C              4       ARRAY     ARRAY     RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL(I)
C
C              WHEN EITHER OF THESE PARAMETERS IS A SCALAR, IT NEED NOT
C              BE DIMENSIONED IN THE USER'S CALLING PROGRAM.
C
C              IF NONE OF THE ABOVE CHOICES (WITH ITOL, RTOL, AND ATOL
C              FIXED THROUGHOUT THE PROBLEM) IS SUITABLE, MORE GENERAL
C              ERROR CONTROLS CAN BE OBTAINED BY SUBSTITUTING
C              USER-SUPPLIED ROUTINES FOR THE SETTING OF EWT AND/OR FOR
C              THE NORM CALCULATION.  SEE PART 4 BELOW.
C
C              IF GLOBAL ERRORS ARE TO BE ESTIMATED BY MAKING A REPEATED
C              RUN ON THE SAME PROBLEM WITH SMALLER TOLERANCES, THEN ALL
C              COMPONENTS OF RTOL AND ATOL (I.E., OF EWT) SHOULD BE
C              SCALED DOWN UNIFORMLY.
C
C     ITASK    AN INDEX SPECIFYING THE TASK TO BE PERFORMED.  INPUT
C              ONLY.  ITASK HAS THE FOLLOWING VALUES AND MEANINGS:
C              1   NORMAL COMPUTATION OF OUTPUT VALUES OF Y(T) AT
C                  T = TOUT (BY OVERSHOOTING AND INTERPOLATING).
C              2   TAKE ONE STEP ONLY AND RETURN.
C              3   STOP AT THE FIRST INTERNAL MESH POINT AT OR BEYOND
C                  T = TOUT AND RETURN.
C              4   NORMAL COMPUTATION OF OUTPUT VALUES OF Y(T) AT
C                  T = TOUT BUT WITHOUT OVERSHOOTING T = TCRIT.  TCRIT
C                  MUST BE INPUT AS RWORK(1).  TCRIT MAY BE EQUAL TO OR
C                  BEYOND TOUT, BUT NOT BEHIND IT IN THE DIRECTION OF
C                  INTEGRATION.  THIS OPTION IS USEFUL IF THE PROBLEM
C                  HAS A SINGULARITY AT OR BEYOND T = TCRIT.
C              5   TAKE ONE STEP, WITHOUT PASSING TCRIT, AND RETURN.
C                  TCRIT MUST BE INPUT AS RWORK(1).
C
C              NOTE:  IF ITASK = 4 OR 5 AND THE SOLVER REACHES TCRIT
C              (WITHIN ROUNDOFF), IT WILL RETURN T = TCRIT (EXACTLY) TO
C              INDICATE THIS (UNLESS ITASK = 4 AND TOUT COMES BEFORE
C              TCRIT, IN WHICH CASE ANSWERS AT T = TOUT ARE RETURNED
C              FIRST).
C
C     ISTATE   AN INDEX USED FOR INPUT AND OUTPUT TO SPECIFY THE STATE
C              OF THE CALCULATION.
C
C              ON INPUT, THE VALUES OF ISTATE ARE AS FOLLOWS:
C              1   THIS IS THE FIRST CALL FOR THE PROBLEM
C                  (INITIALIZATIONS WILL BE DONE).  SEE "NOTE" BELOW.
C              2   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CALL, AND THE CALCULATION IS TO
C                  CONTINUE NORMALLY, WITH NO CHANGE IN ANY INPUT
C                  PARAMETERS EXCEPT POSSIBLY TOUT AND ITASK.  (IF ITOL,
C                  RTOL, AND/OR ATOL ARE CHANGED BETWEEN CALLS WITH
C                  ISTATE = 2, THE NEW VALUES WILL BE USED BUT NOT
C                  TESTED FOR LEGALITY.)
C              3   THIS IS NOT THE FIRST CALL, AND THE CALCULATION IS TO
C                  CONTINUE NORMALLY, BUT WITH A CHANGE IN INPUT
C                  PARAMETERS OTHER THAN TOUT AND ITASK.  CHANGES ARE
C                  ALLOWED IN NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, MF,
C                  ML, MU, AND ANY OF THE OPTIONAL INPUTS EXCEPT H0.
C                  (SEE IWORK DESCRIPTION FOR ML AND MU.)
C
C              NOTE:  A PRELIMINARY CALL WITH TOUT = T IS NOT COUNTED AS
C              A FIRST CALL HERE, AS NO INITIALIZATION OR CHECKING OF
C              INPUT IS DONE.  (SUCH A CALL IS SOMETIMES USEFUL FOR THE
C              PURPOSE OF OUTPUTTING THE INITIAL CONDITIONS.)  THUS THE
C              FIRST CALL FOR WHICH TOUT .NE. T REQUIRES ISTATE = 1 ON
C              INPUT.
C
C              ON OUTPUT, ISTATE HAS THE FOLLOWING VALUES AND MEANINGS:
C               1  NOTHING WAS DONE, AS TOUT WAS EQUAL TO T WITH
C                  ISTATE = 1 ON INPUT.
C               2  THE INTEGRATION WAS PERFORMED SUCCESSFULLY.
C              -1  AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK (MORE THAN MXSTEP STEPS)
C                  WAS DONE ON THIS CALL, BEFORE COMPLETING THE
C                  REQUESTED TASK, BUT THE INTEGRATION WAS OTHERWISE
C                  SUCCESSFUL AS FAR AS T. (MXSTEP IS AN OPTIONAL INPUT
C                  AND IS NORMALLY 500.)  TO CONTINUE, THE USER MAY
C                  SIMPLY RESET ISTATE TO A VALUE >1 AND CALL AGAIN (THE
C                  EXCESS WORK STEP COUNTER WILL BE RESET TO 0).  IN
C                  ADDITION, THE USER MAY INCREASE MXSTEP TO AVOID THIS
C                  ERROR RETURN; SEE "OPTIONAL INPUTS" BELOW.
C              -2  TOO MUCH ACCURACY WAS REQUESTED FOR THE PRECISION OF
C                  THE MACHINE BEING USED.  THIS WAS DETECTED BEFORE
C                  COMPLETING THE REQUESTED TASK, BUT THE INTEGRATION
C                  WAS SUCCESSFUL AS FAR AS T. TO CONTINUE, THE
C                  TOLERANCE PARAMETERS MUST BE RESET, AND ISTATE MUST
C                  BE SET TO 3. THE OPTIONAL OUTPUT TOLSF MAY BE USED
C                  FOR THIS PURPOSE.  (NOTE:  IF THIS CONDITION IS
C                  DETECTED BEFORE TAKING ANY STEPS, THEN AN ILLEGAL
C                  INPUT RETURN (ISTATE = -3) OCCURS INSTEAD.)

C
C              NOTE:  SINCE THE NORMAL OUTPUT VALUE OF ISTATE IS 2, IT
C              DOES NOT NEED TO BE RESET FOR NORMAL CONTINUATION.  ALSO,
C              SINCE A NEGATIVE INPUT VALUE OF ISTATE WILL BE REGARDED
C              AS ILLEGAL, A NEGATIVE OUTPUT VALUE REQUIRES THE USER TO

C
C              THE FOLLOWING TWO WORDS IN IWORK ARE CONDITIONAL INPUTS:
C              IWORK(1) = ML   THESE ARE THE LOWER AND UPPER HALF-

C              (THIS WILL BE CHECKED BY THE SOLVER.)
C
C     NOTE:  THE WORK ARRAYS MUST NOT BE ALTERED BETWEEN CALLS TO DLSODE
C     FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR THE CONDITIONAL AND
C     OPTIONAL INPUTS, AND EXCEPT FOR THE LAST 3*NEQ WORDS OF RWORK.
C     THE LATTER SPACE IS USED FOR INTERNAL SCRATCH SPACE, AND SO IS
C     AVAILABLE FOR USE BY THE USER OUTSIDE DLSODE BETWEEN CALLS, IF
C     DESIRED (BUT NOT FOR USE BY F OR JAC).
C
C     JAC      THE NAME OF THE USER-SUPPLIED ROUTINE (MITER = 1 OR 4) TO
C              COMPUTE THE JACOBIAN MATRIX, DF/DY, AS A FUNCTION OF THE
C              SCALAR T AND THE VECTOR Y.  (SEE THE MF DESCRIPTION BELOW
C              FOR MITER.)  IT IS TO HAVE THE FORM
C
C                 SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C                 DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C
C              WHERE NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, AND NROWPD ARE INPUT AND THE
C              ARRAY PD IS TO BE LOADED WITH PARTIAL DERIVATIVES
C              (ELEMENTS OF THE JACOBIAN MATRIX) ON OUTPUT.  PD MUST BE
C              GIVEN A FIRST DIMENSION OF NROWPD.  T AND Y HAVE THE SAME
C              MEANING AS IN SUBROUTINE F.
C
C              IN THE FULL MATRIX CASE (MITER = 1), ML AND MU ARE
C              IGNORED, AND THE JACOBIAN IS TO BE LOADED INTO PD IN
C              COLUMNWISE MANNER, WITH DF(I)/DY(J) LOADED INTO PD(I,J).
C
C              IN THE BAND MATRIX CASE (MITER = 4), THE ELEMENTS WITHIN
C              THE BAND ARE TO BE LOADED INTO PD IN COLUMNWISE MANNER,
C              WITH DIAGONAL LINES OF DF/DY LOADED INTO THE ROWS OF PD.
C              THUS DF(I)/DY(J) IS TO BE LOADED INTO PD(I-J+MU+1,J).  ML
C              AND MU ARE THE HALF-BANDWIDTH PARAMETERS (SEE IWORK).
C              THE LOCATIONS IN PD IN THE TWO TRIANGULAR AREAS WHICH
C              CORRESPOND TO NONEXISTENT MATRIX ELEMENTS CAN BE IGNORED
C              OR LOADED ARBITRARILY, AS THEY ARE OVERWRITTEN BY DLSODE.
C
C              JAC NEED NOT PROVIDE DF/DY EXACTLY. A CRUDE APPROXIMATION
C              (POSSIBLY WITH A SMALLER BANDWIDTH) WILL DO.
C
C              IN EITHER CASE, PD IS PRESET TO ZERO BY THE SOLVER, SO
C              THAT ONLY THE NONZERO ELEMENTS NEED BE LOADED BY JAC.
C              EACH CALL TO JAC IS PRECEDED BY A CALL TO F WITH THE SAME
C              ARGUMENTS NEQ, T, AND Y. THUS TO GAIN SOME EFFICIENCY,
C              INTERMEDIATE QUANTITIES SHARED BY BOTH CALCULATIONS MAY
C              BE SAVED IN A USER COMMON BLOCK BY F AND NOT RECOMPUTED
C              BY JAC, IF DESIRED.  ALSO, JAC MAY ALTER THE Y ARRAY, IF
C              DESIRED.  JAC MUST BE DECLARED EXTERNAL IN THE CALLING
C              PROGRAM.
C
C              SUBROUTINE JAC MAY ACCESS USER-DEFINED QUANTITIES IN
C              NEQ(2),... AND/OR IN Y(NEQ(1)+1),... IF NEQ IS AN ARRAY
C              (DIMENSIONED IN JAC) AND/OR Y HAS LENGTH EXCEEDING
C              NEQ(1).  SEE THE DESCRIPTIONS OF NEQ AND Y ABOVE.

C                  (BDF'S).
C
C              MITER INDICATES THE CORRECTOR ITERATION METHOD:

C                  INVOLVED).
C              1   CHORD ITERATION WITH A USER-SUPPLIED FULL (NEQ BY

C                  JACOBIAN (USING ML + MU + 1 EXTRA CALLS TO F PER
C                  DF/DY EVALUATION).
C
C              IF MITER = 1 OR 4, THE USER MUST SUPPLY A SUBROUTINE JAC
C              (THE NAME IS ARBITRARY) AS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER JAC.
C              FOR OTHER VALUES OF MITER, A DUMMY ARGUMENT CAN BE USED.
C
C     OPTIONAL INPUTS
C     ---------------
C     THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE OPTIONAL INPUTS PROVIDED FOR IN THE
C     CALL SEQUENCE.  (SEE ALSO PART 2.)  FOR EACH SUCH INPUT VARIABLE,
C     THIS TABLE LISTS ITS NAME AS USED IN THIS DOCUMENTATION, ITS
C     LOCATION IN THE CALL SEQUENCE, ITS MEANING, AND THE DEFAULT VALUE.
C     THE USE OF ANY OF THESE INPUTS REQUIRES IOPT = 1, AND IN THAT CASE
C     ALL OF THESE INPUTS ARE EXAMINED.  A VALUE OF ZERO FOR ANY OF
C     THESE OPTIONAL INPUTS WILL CAUSE THE DEFAULT VALUE TO BE USED.
C     THUS TO USE A SUBSET OF THE OPTIONAL INPUTS, SIMPLY PRELOAD
C     LOCATIONS 5 TO 10 IN RWORK AND IWORK TO 0.0 AND 0 RESPECTIVELY,
C     AND THEN SET THOSE OF INTEREST TO NONZERO VALUES.

C                        MF DESCRIPTION ABOVE FOR METH.)  IF MAXORD
C                        EXCEEDS THE DEFAULT VALUE, IT WILL BE REDUCED
C                        TO THE DEFAULT VALUE.  IF MAXORD IS CHANGED
C                        DURING THE PROBLEM, IT MAY CAUSE THE CURRENT
C                        ORDER TO BE REDUCED.
C     MXSTEP  IWORK(6)   MAXIMUM NUMBER OF (INTERNALLY DEFINED) STEPS
C                        ALLOWED DURING ONE CALL TO THE SOLVER.  THE

C                        (H = STEP SIZE).  THIS MUST BE POSITIVE TO
C                        RESULT IN A NONDEFAULT VALUE.  THE DEFAULT
C                        VALUE IS 10.

C     AS OPTIONAL ADDITIONAL OUTPUT FROM DLSODE, THE VARIABLES LISTED
C     BELOW ARE QUANTITIES RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF DLSODE WHICH 
C     ARE AVAILABLE TO THE USER.  THESE ARE COMMUNICATED BY WAY OF THE

C                               (SEE PART 3 BELOW).  RSAV MUST BE A
C                               REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH 218 OR MORE, AND
C                               ISAV MUST BE AN INTEGER ARRAY OF LENGTH

C     CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        PROVIDE DERIVATIVES OF Y, OF VARIOUS
C     (SEE BELOW)               ORDERS, AT A SPECIFIED POINT T, IF
C                               DESIRED.  IT MAY BE CALLED ONLY AFTER A
C                               SUCCESSFUL RETURN FROM DLSODE.  DETAILED
C                               INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOW.
C
C     DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DINTDY
C     --------------------------------------
C     THE FORM OF THE CALL IS:
C
C           CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C     THE INPUT PARAMETERS ARE:
C
C     T          VALUE OF INDEPENDENT VARIABLE WHERE ANSWERS ARE
C                DESIRED (NORMALLY THE SAME AS THE T LAST RETURNED BY
C                DLSODE).  FOR VALID RESULTS, T MUST LIE BETWEEN
C                TCUR - HU AND TCUR.  (SEE "OPTIONAL OUTPUTS" ABOVE
C                FOR TCUR AND HU.)
C     K          INTEGER ORDER OF THE DERIVATIVE DESIRED.  K MUST
C                SATISFY 0 <= K <= NQCUR, WHERE NQCUR IS THE CURRENT
C                ORDER (SEE "OPTIONAL OUTPUTS").  THE CAPABILITY
C                CORRESPONDING TO K = 0, I.E., COMPUTING Y(T), IS
C                ALREADY PROVIDED BY DLSODE DIRECTLY.  SINCE
C                NQCUR >= 1, THE FIRST DERIVATIVE DY/DT IS ALWAYS
C                AVAILABLE WITH DINTDY.
C     RWORK(21)  THE BASE ADDRESS OF THE HISTORY ARRAY YH.
C     NYH        COLUMN LENGTH OF YH, EQUAL TO THE INITIAL VALUE OF NEQ.
C
C     THE OUTPUT PARAMETERS ARE:
C
C     DKY        REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH NEQ CONTAINING THE COMPUTED VALUE
C                OF THE KTH DERIVATIVE OF Y(T).
C     IFLAG      INTEGER FLAG, RETURNED AS 0 IF K AND T WERE LEGAL,
C                -1 IF K WAS ILLEGAL, AND -2 IF T WAS ILLEGAL.
C                ON AN ERROR RETURN, A MESSAGE IS ALSO WRITTEN.
C
C
C                          PART 3.  COMMON BLOCKS
C                          ----------------------
C
C     IF DLSODE IS TO BE USED IN AN OVERLAY SITUATION, THE USER MUST
C     DECLARE, IN THE PRIMARY OVERLAY, THE VARIABLES IN:
C     (1) THE CALL SEQUENCE TO DLSODE,
C     (2) THE INTERNAL COMMON BLOCK /DLS001/, OF LENGTH 255 
C         (218 DOUBLE PRECISION WORDS FOLLOWED BY 37 INTEGER WORDS).
C
C     IF DLSODE IS USED ON A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE CONTENTS OF INTERNAL
C     COMMON BLOCKS ARE NOT PRESERVED BETWEEN CALLS, THE USER SHOULD
C     DECLARE THE ABOVE COMMON BLOCK IN HIS MAIN PROGRAM TO INSURE THAT
C     ITS CONTENTS ARE PRESERVED.
C
C     IF THE SOLUTION OF A GIVEN PROBLEM BY DLSODE IS TO BE INTERRUPTED
C     AND THEN LATER CONTINUED, AS WHEN RESTARTING AN INTERRUPTED RUN OR
C     ALTERNATING BETWEEN TWO OR MORE PROBLEMS, THE USER SHOULD SAVE,
C     FOLLOWING THE RETURN FROM THE LAST DLSODE CALL PRIOR TO THE
C     INTERRUPTION, THE CONTENTS OF THE CALL SEQUENCE VARIABLES AND THE
C     INTERNAL COMMON BLOCK, AND LATER RESTORE THESE VALUES BEFORE THE
C     NEXT DLSODE CALL FOR THAT PROBLEM.   IN ADDITION, IF XSETUN AND/OR
C     XSETF WAS CALLED FOR NON-DEFAULT HANDLING OF ERROR MESSAGES, THEN
C     THESE CALLS MUST BE REPEATED.  TO SAVE AND RESTORE THE COMMON
C     BLOCK, USE SUBROUTINE DSRCOM (SEE PART 2 ABOVE).
C
C
C              PART 4.  OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE SOLVER ROUTINES
C              -----------------------------------------------
C
C     BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF TWO ROUTINES IN THE DLSODE PACKAGE WHICH
C     RELATE TO THE MEASUREMENT OF ERRORS.  EITHER ROUTINE CAN BE
C     REPLACED BY A USER-SUPPLIED VERSION, IF DESIRED.  HOWEVER, SINCE
C     SUCH A REPLACEMENT MAY HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON PERFORMANCE, IT
C     SHOULD BE DONE ONLY WHEN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, AND ONLY WITH GREAT
C     CAUTION.  (NOTE:  THE MEANS BY WHICH THE PACKAGE VERSION OF A
C     ROUTINE IS SUPERSEDED BY THE USER'S VERSION MAY BE SYSTEM-
C     DEPENDENT.)
C
C     DEWSET
C     ------
C     THE FOLLOWING SUBROUTINE IS CALLED JUST BEFORE EACH INTERNAL
C     INTEGRATION STEP, AND SETS THE ARRAY OF ERROR WEIGHTS, EWT, AS
C     DESCRIBED UNDER ITOL/RTOL/ATOL ABOVE:
C
C           SUBROUTINE DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C
C     WHERE NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, AND ATOL ARE AS IN THE DLSODE CALL
C     SEQUENCE, YCUR CONTAINS THE CURRENT DEPENDENT VARIABLE VECTOR,
C     AND EWT IS THE ARRAY OF WEIGHTS SET BY DEWSET.
C
C     IF THE USER SUPPLIES THIS SUBROUTINE, IT MUST RETURN IN EWT(I)
C     (I = 1,...,NEQ) A POSITIVE QUANTITY SUITABLE FOR COMPARING ERRORS
C     IN Y(I) TO.  THE EWT ARRAY RETURNED BY DEWSET IS PASSED TO THE
C     DVNORM ROUTINE (SEE BELOW), AND ALSO USED BY DLSODE IN THE
C     COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIONAL OUTPUT IMXER, THE DIAGONAL JACOBIAN
C     APPROXIMATION, AND THE INCREMENTS FOR DIFFERENCE QUOTIENT
C     JACOBIANS.
C
C     IN THE USER-SUPPLIED VERSION OF DEWSET, IT MAY BE DESIRABLE TO USE
C     THE CURRENT VALUES OF DERIVATIVES OF Y. DERIVATIVES UP TO ORDER NQ
C     ARE AVAILABLE FROM THE HISTORY ARRAY YH, DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER
C     OPTIONAL OUTPUTS.  IN DEWSET, YH IS IDENTICAL TO THE YCUR ARRAY,
C     EXTENDED TO NQ + 1 COLUMNS WITH A COLUMN LENGTH OF NYH AND SCALE
C     FACTORS OF H**J/FACTORIAL(J).  ON THE FIRST CALL FOR THE PROBLEM,
C     GIVEN BY NST = 0, NQ IS 1 AND H IS TEMPORARILY SET TO 1.0.
C     NYH IS THE INITIAL VALUE OF NEQ.  THE QUANTITIES NQ, H, AND NST
C     CAN BE OBTAINED BY INCLUDING IN SEWSET THE STATEMENTS:
C           DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C           NQ = ILS(33)
C           NST = ILS(34)
C           H = RLS(212)
C     THUS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CURRENT VALUE OF DY/DT CAN BE OBTAINED AS
C     YCUR(NYH+I)/H (I=1,...,NEQ) (AND THE DIVISION BY H IS UNNECESSARY
C     WHEN NST = 0).
C
C     DVNORM
C     ------
C     DVNORM IS A REAL FUNCTION ROUTINE WHICH COMPUTES THE WEIGHTED
C     ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE NORM OF A VECTOR V:
C
C        D = DVNORM (N, V, W)
C
C     WHERE:
C     N = THE LENGTH OF THE VECTOR,
C     V = REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH N CONTAINING THE VECTOR,
C     W = REAL ARRAY OF LENGTH N CONTAINING WEIGHTS,
C     D = SQRT( (1/N) * SUM(V(I)*W(I))**2 ).
C
C     DVNORM IS CALLED WITH N = NEQ AND WITH W(I) = 1.0/EWT(I), WHERE
C     EWT IS AS SET BY SUBROUTINE DEWSET.
C
C     IF THE USER SUPPLIES THIS FUNCTION, IT SHOULD RETURN A NONNEGATIVE
C     VALUE OF DVNORM SUITABLE FOR USE IN THE ERROR CONTROL IN DLSODE.
C     NONE OF THE ARGUMENTS SHOULD BE ALTERED BY DVNORM.  FOR EXAMPLE, A
C     USER-SUPPLIED DVNORM ROUTINE MIGHT:
C     - SUBSTITUTE A MAX-NORM OF (V(I)*W(I)) FOR THE RMS-NORM, OR
C     - IGNORE SOME COMPONENTS OF V IN THE NORM, WITH THE EFFECT OF
C       SUPPRESSING THE ERROR CONTROL ON THOSE COMPONENTS OF Y.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C  IXSAV SAVES AND RECALLS ONE OF TWO ERROR MESSAGE PARAMETERS:
C    LUNIT, THE LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER TO WHICH MESSAGES ARE PRINTED, AND
C    MESFLG, THE MESSAGE PRINT FLAG.
C  THIS IS A MODIFICATION OF THE SLATEC LIBRARY ROUTINE J4SAVE.
C
C  SAVED LOCAL VARIABLES..
C   LUNIT  = LOGICAL UNIT NUMBER FOR MESSAGES.  THE DEFAULT IS OBTAINED
C            BY A CALL TO IUMACH (MAY BE MACHINE-DEPENDENT).
C   MESFLG = PRINT CONTROL FLAG..
C            1 MEANS PRINT ALL MESSAGES (THE DEFAULT).
C            0 MEANS NO PRINTING.
C
C  ON INPUT..
C    IPAR   = PARAMETER INDICATOR (1 FOR LUNIT, 2 FOR MESFLG).
C    IVALUE = THE VALUE TO BE SET FOR THE PARAMETER, IF ISET = .TRUE.
C    ISET   = LOGICAL FLAG TO INDICATE WHETHER TO READ OR WRITE.
C             IF ISET = .TRUE., THE PARAMETER WILL BE GIVEN
C             THE VALUE IVALUE.  IF ISET = .FALSE., THE PARAMETER
C             WILL BE UNCHANGED, AND IVALUE IS A DUMMY ARGUMENT.
C
