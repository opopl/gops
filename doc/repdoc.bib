  abstract={
Molecular chaperones, many of them so-called heat-shock or stress proteins
(hsps), have emerged over recent years as an important topic in cell biology.
The functions of these proteins under normal cellular conditions as well as
under conditions of stress are the focus of intensive research activity of cell
biologists, biochemists, and, more recently, biophysicists. From the wealth
of studies available to date, it appears that the major importance of molecular
chaperones lies in the area of protein folding. The long-held view that newly
synthesized proteins in the cell fold in a largely spontaneous process has been
called into question. Although the basic principle that the primary sequence
of a protein is sufficient to specify its three-dimensional structure remains
unchallenged, protein folding in cells, as opposed to the test tube, depends
on helper proteins (Table 1). In this review we focus on the function of the
major hsp70, hsp60, and hsp90 classes of molecular chaperones, emphasizing
the functional cooperation between different chaperones and their interactions
with specific regulatory proteins. We summarize the major lines of evidence
(1-59) that molecular chaperones are involved in a multitude of processes, in
different cellular compartments, wherever the folded state of proteins has to
be achieved de novo, stabilized under stress conditions, or modulated to
regulate their activity state. Our discussion also includes the recently discov­
ered chaperones of the TCP1 family, which may have hsp60-like functions in
the eukaryotic cytosol. For an overview of the functions of other non-heat­
shock chaperone systems, the reader may be referred to recent articles by
Gething & Sambrook (60) and Freedman (61).

	title={Introduction to protein folding for physicists},
	abstract={ The prediction of the three-dimensional native structure of proteins 
from the knowledge of their amino acid sequence, 
known as the protein folding problem, is one of the 
most important yet unsolved issues of modern science. 
Since the conformational behaviour of flexible molecules is nothing more than a
complex physical problem, increasingly more physicists are moving into the
study of protein systems, bringing with them powerful mathematical and
computational tools, as well as the sharp intuition and deep images inherent to
the physics discipline. This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of
such a transition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive
account of the reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous
relevance and summarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving
it. We also provide an introduction to the particular structure of these
biological heteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the
assumptions behind this (commonly implicit) definition. Finally, we review the
`special flavor' of statistical mechanics that is typically used to study the
astronomically large phase spaces of macromolecules. Throughout the whole work,
much material that is found scattered in the literature has been put together
here to improve comprehension and to serve as a handy reference.  },

	Using a simulated annealing procedure in sequence space, we have

	study. The sequence design algorithm generated sequences for which
	the native structures is a pronounced global energy minimum. Then,

	of folding. In each run, starting from a random coil conformation,
	the chain reached its native structure, which is indicative that
	the model proteins solve the Levinthal paradox. The folding mechanism
	involved nucleation growth. Formation of a specific nucleus, which
	is a particular pattern of contacts, is shown to be a necessary and
	sufficient condition for subsequent rapid folding to the native state.
	The nucleus represents a transition state of folding to the molten
	globule conformation. The search for the nucleus is a rate-limiting
	step of folding and corresponds to overcoming the major free energy
	barrier. We also observed a folding pathway that is the approach
	to the native state after nucleus formation; this stage takes about
	1\% of the simulation time. The nucleus is a spatially localized
	substructure of the native state having 8 out of 40 native contacts.
	However, monomers belonging to the nucleus are scattered along the
	sequence, so that several nucleus contacts are long-range while other
	are short-range. A folding nucleus was also found in a longer chain
	80-mer, where it also constituted 20\% of the native structure. The
	possible mechanism of folding of designed proteins, as well as the
	experimental implications of this study is discussed.},

frustrated energy landscape at the collapse temperature with a significant

variance from the law of large numbers. The principal components are analyzed
by an embedding nonlinear time-series analysis. The fast fluctuations with
small amplitudes of ∼70−80% of the principal components cause the time series
to become almost “random” in only 100 simulation steps. However, the stochastic
feature of the principal components tends to be suppressed through a wide range
of degrees of freedom at the transition temperature. }

protein of 46 amino beads with three different types of residues. We show how
the motion of the model protein changes depending on the space scales and the
choices of degrees of freedom. In particular, anomalous superdiffusion is
revealed along the low-indexed PC in the unfolded state. The implication of
superdiffusion in the process of folding is also discussed.  }

measuring the mechanical properties of protein L, a domain with a topology
predicted to be mechanically strong, but with no known mechanical function. A
pentamer of this small, topologically simple protein is resistant to mechanical
deformation over a wide range of extension rates. Molecular dynamics
simulations show the energy landscape for protein L is highly restricted for
mechanical unfolding and that this protein unfolds by the shearing apart of two
structural units in a mechanism similar to that proposed for ubiquitin, which
belongs to the same structural class as protein L, but unfolds at a
significantly higher force. These data suggest that the mechanism of mechanical
unfolding is conserved in proteins within the same fold family and demonstrate
that although the topology and presence of a hydrogen-bonded clamp are of
central importance in determining mechanical strength, hydrophobic interactions
also play an important role in modulating the mechanical resistance of these
similar proteins.}"

to be applied to the same all-beta protein, E2lip3, in two different

markedly anisotropic. These results, in combination with molecular dynamics (
MD) simulations, reveal that the unfolding pathway depends on the pulling
geometry and is associated with unfolding forces that differ by an order of

   A sawtooth pattern was observed in the force curves where each force
   peak reports on the unfolding of an I27 domain. In early unfolding
   events, we observed a ``hump-like{''} deviation due to the detachment
   of beta-strand A from each I27 domain. The force at which the humps
   appear was similar to 130 pN and showed no temperature dependence, at
   least in the temperature range of 2 degrees C-30 degrees C. The hump
   structure was successfully analyzed with a two-state worm-like chain
   model, and the Gibbs free energy difference of the detachment reaction
   was estimated to be 11.6 +/- 0.58 kcal/mol and found to be temperature
   independent. By contrast, upon lowering the temperature, the mean
   unfolding force from the partly unfolded intermediate state was found
   to markedly increase and the unfolding force distribution to broaden
   significantly, suggesting that the distance (x(u)) between the folded
   and transition states in the energy landscape along the pulling
   direction is decreased. These results suggest that the local structure
   of beta-strand A are stabilized by topologically simple local
   hydrogen-bond network and that the temperature does not affect the
   detachment reaction thermodynamically and kinetically, whereas the
   interaction between the beta-strands A' and G, which is a critical

present paper, we obtain the free energy surface and conformations involved in

is downhill in free energy, followed by rearrangement to form a structure with
part of the hydrophobic cluster; the hairpin hydrogen bonds propagate outwards
in both directions from the partial cluster. Such a folding mechanism differs

Abstract = {{Elimination of an interaction which forms in denatured cytochrome c
   enables the majority of the molecules to fold to the native state on a
   15 ms time scale, without populating observable intermediates. These
   results are contrary to the current view that particular steps in
   protein folding, including the supposedly rate-limiting molten globule
   to native transition, are intrinsically slow. Instead it appears that
   intermediates characterized so far may be kinetically trapped by
   barriers that are optional rather than integral to the folding process.
   Major barriers may result from misorganization of the chain in the
   initial condensation step.}}

Abstract = {{Topological characteristics of multidimensional potential energy
   surfaces are explored and the full conformation space is mapped on the
   set of local minima. This map partitions conformation space into
   energy-dependent or temperature-dependent `'attraction basins'' and
   generates `'disconnectivity'' graph that reflects the basin
   connectivity and characterizes the shape of the multidimensional
   surface. The partitioning of the conformation space is used to express
   the temporal behavior of the system in terms of basin-to-basin kinetics
   instead of the usual state-to-state transitions. For this purpose the
   transition matrix of the system is expressed in terms of basin-to-basin
   transitions and the corresponding master equation is solved. As an
   example, the approach is applied to the tetrapeptide,
   isobutyryl-(ala)(3)-NH-methyl (IAN), which is the shortest peptide that
   can form a full helical turn. A nearly complete List of minima and
   barriers is available for this system from the work of Czerminiski and
   Elber. The multidimensional potential energy surface of the peptide is
   shown to exhibit an overall `'funnel'' shape. The relation between
   connectivity and spatial proximity in dihedral angle space is examined.
   It is found that, although the two are similar, closeness in one does
   not always imply closeness in the other. The basin to basin kinetics is
   examined using a master equation and the results are interpreted in
   terms of kinetic connectivity. The conformation space of the peptide is
   divided up in terms of the surface topography to model its `'folding''
   behavior. Even in this very simple system, the kinetics exhibit a
   `'trapping'' state which appears as a `'kinetic intermediate,'' as in
   the folding of proteins. The approach described here can be used more
   generally to classify multidimensional potential energy surface sand
   the time development of complex systems. (C) 1997 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Folding of lysozyme from hen egg white was investigated by using
   interrupted refolding experiments. This method makes use of a high
   energy barrier between the native state and transient folding
   intermediates, and, in contrast to conventional optical techniques, it
   enables one to specifically monitor the amount of native molecules
   during protein folding. The results show that under strongly native
   conditions lysozyme can refold on parallel pathways. The major part of
   the lysozyme molecules (86\%) refold on a slow kinetic pathway with
   well-populated partially folded states. Additionally, 14\% of the
   molecules fold faster. The rate constant of formation of native
   molecules on the fast pathway corresponds well to the rate constant
   expected for folding to occur by a two-state process without any
   detectable intermediates. The results suggest that formation of the
   native state for the major fraction of lysozyme molecules is retarded
   compared with the direct folding process. Partially structured
   intermediates that transiently populate seem to be kinetically trapped
   in a conformation that can only slowly reach the native structure.}}

Abstract = {{We investigated a chaperone mechanism of protein folding using a 36-mer
   model on a cubic lattice. The mechanism simulates folding, which
   proceeds with repetitive cycles of binding, unfolding, and releasing of
   misfolded metastable states. We measured the yield enhancement due to
   this mechanism for sequences selected by evolutionary design and showed
   that the binding and releasing mechanism is efficient for the yield
   enhancement of folding for sequences that are poorly designed, i.e.,
   where selection is not adequately strong. From this it follows that the
   chaperone mechanism can be considered as the evolutionary alternative
   to compensate for poor sequence design. On the other hand, random
   sequences show a decrease in yield and no effect on the total mean
   first passage time when the proposed chaperone mechanism is
   implemented, thus implying that sequence optimization is a necessary
   condition for the efficiency of the proposed mechanism. We
   qualitatively reproduced experimental results for folding in the
   presence of GroEL/GroES, fit our results with the aid of a
   double-exponential model of folding kinetics, and characterized the

Abstract = {{The statistical energy landscape picture of protein folding has led to
   the understanding that the energy landscape must have guiding forces
   leading to a protein folding funnel in order to avoid the Levinthal
   paradox in vitro. Since folding in vivo often requires the action of
   chaperone molecules and ATP hydrolysis, we must ask whether folding in
   a system maintained away from equilibrium can avoid the Levinthal
   paradox in other ways. We describe a model of the action of chaperone
   molecules in protein folding in vivo on the basis of a repetitive cycle
   of binding and unbinding, allowing the possibility of kinetic
   proofreading. We also study models in which chaperone binding is
   locally biased, depending on the similarity of the conformation to the
   native one. We show that while kinetic proofreading can modestly
   facilitate folding, it is insufficient by itself to overcome the
   Levinthal paradox. On the other hand, such kinetic proofreading with
   biasing can provide the nonequilibrium analog of a folding funnel and
   greatly enhance folding yields and speed up folding.}}

simulation (umbrella sampling) method, with a bias-potential method used
earlier in our accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that
the hydrophobic interaction enhances the stability of alpha helices at both low
and high temperatures but stabilizes beta structures only at high temperatures
at which alpha helices are not stable. The nearest-neighbor dipole-dipole
interaction stabilizes beta structures under all conditions, especially in the
low temperature region where alpha helices are the stable structures. Our
results indicate clearly that the dipole-dipole interaction between the nearest
neighboring amide planes plays an important role in determining the peptide

for understanding the effects of different forms of interactions on polypeptide

   folding, the iterative annealing mechanism, based on theoretical
   descriptions of `'rugged'' conformational free energy landscapes for

   by a nucleation mechanism whereby correct and incorrect nucleation lead
   to fast and slow folding kinetics, respectively, and (ii) chaperonins
   optimize the rate acid yield of protein folding by an active
   ATP-dependent process. The chaperonins GroEL and GroES catalyze the
   folding of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase at a rate proportional to
   the GroEL concentration. Kinetically trapped folding-incompetent
   conformers of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are converted to the
   native state in a reaction involving multiple rounds of quantized ATP
   hydrolysis by GroEL. We propose that chaperonins optimize protein
   folding by an iterative annealing mechanism; they repeatedly bind
   kinetically trapped conformers, randomly disrupt their structure, and
   release them in less folded states, allowing substrate proteins
   multiple opportunities to find pathways leading to the most

   ternary complex with GroES and nucleotide (bulletlike structures). With
   each subsequent turnover, ATP was hydrolyzed by one ring of GroEL in a
   quantized manner, completely releasing the adenosine diphosphate and
   GroES that were tightly bound to the other ring as a result of the
   previous turnover. The catalytic cycle involved formation of a

   ubiquitin, a small cytoplasmic protein with an extended beta-sheet and

   investigated by hydrogen-deuterium exchange labeling in conjunction
   with rapid mixing methods and two-dimensional NMR analysis. The time
   course of protection from exchange has been measured for 26 backbone
   amide protons that form stable hydrogen bonds upon refolding and
   exchange slowly under native conditions. Amide protons in the
   beta-sheet and the alpha-helix, as well as protons involved in hydrogen
   bonds at the helix/sheet interface, become 80\% protected in an initial
   8-ms folding phase, indicating that the two elements of secondary
   structure form and associate in a common cooperative folding event.
   Somewhat slower protection rates for residues 59, 61, and 69 provide
   evidence for the subsequent stabilization of a surface loop. Most
   probes also exhibit two minor phases with time constants of about 100
   ms and 10 s. Only two of the observed residues, Gln-41 and Arg-42,
   display significant slow folding phases, with amplitudes of 37\% and
   22\%, respectively, which can be attributed to native-like folding
   intermediates containing cis peptide bonds for Pro-37 and/or Pro-38.
   Compared with other proteins studied by pulse labeling, including
   cytochrome c, ribonuclease, and barnase, the initial formation of
   hydrogen-bonded structure in ubiquitin occurs at a more rapid rate and

to exhibit ordered and highly disordered structures. The disordered high‐energy
stable packings of (KCl)32 are identified as amorphous structures. We term the
large collection of amorphous (KCl)32 structures the ‘‘microamorphous’’ state,
on the basis that they are as disordered as the bulk glass phase. Liquid
(KCl)32 was quenched to investigate how fast the cooling rate must be to trap
(KCl)32 in one of the high‐energy amorphous structures. Even at unrealistically
fast cooling rates, (KCl)32 was able to locate its microcrystal structure. A
shielded Coulomb interaction potential was used to test whether reducing the
range of the pairwise potential would make it possible to prepare amorphous
binary clusters. Several different values of the shielding range were tested.
These results are discussed in terms of the structure of the underlying
potential energy surface. A short study was conducted of the temperature
dependence of the time it takes, on average, for supercooled (KCl)32 to relax
into the crystalline regions of its potential energy surface. Lastly, we
rationalize, in terms of the potential energy surface, the qualitative
temperature dependence of the heat capacity for both the first‐order and glass
transitions.

technique to add to the toolbox of protein (un)folding methods. However,
detailed analysis of the unfolding of proteins on application of force has, to

interpretation of mutant data. Here we describe how protein engineering (D
value analysis can be adapted to characterize the transition states for
mechanical unfolding of proteins. Single-molecule studies also have an
advantage over bulk experiments, in that partial Phi values arising from
partial structure in the transition state can be clearly distinguished from
those averaged over alternate pathways. We show that unfolding rate constants
derived in the standard way by using Monte Carlo simulations are not reliable
because of the errors involved. However, it is possible to circumvent these
problems, providing the unfolding mechanism is not changed by mutation, either
by a modification of the Monte Carlo procedure or by comparing mutant and
wild-type data directly. The applicability of the method is tested on simulated
data sets and experimental data for mutants of titin 127.}" }

	from coarse-grained simulations of ubiquitin. Unfolding rates calculated
	from simulations over a broad range of stretching forces, for different

	akin to the "roll-over" in unfolding rates sometimes seen in studies

	in one dimension, we demonstrate that it can occur for dynamics in
	just two dimensions. We relate the turnover to the quality of the
	pulling direction as a reaction coordinate for the intrinsic folding
	mechanism. A novel pulling direction, designed to be the most relevant
	to the intrinsic folding pathway, results in the smallest turnover.
	Our results are in accord with protein engineering experiments and

  abstract = {Atomic force spectroscopy has become a widely used technique for investigating
	forces, energies, and dynamics of biomolecular interactions. These
	studies provide dissociation kinetic parameters by pulling apart
	proteins involved in a complex. Biological complexes are studied
	under near-physiological conditions, without labeling procedures,
	and are probed one at time, the latter allowing to one obtain results
	which are not averaged over the ensemble. However, to gain reliable
	information, some experimental aspects have to be carefully controlled.
	In particular, the immobilization of molecular partners to AFM tips
	and supports, required to force the molecular dissociation, plays
	a crucial role in determining the success of the experiments. To
	actually resolve single interactions, multiple simultaneous complex
	dissociations have to be avoided, and nonspecific adhesions, commonly
	found in these studies, have to be recognized and discarded. This
	article is aimed at offering a critical revisitation of the atomic
	force spectroscopy technique applied to the study of biomolecular
	interactions, highlighting the critical points, identifying strategies
	to be adopted for a more reliable data extraction and interpretation,
	and pointing out the experimental and theoretical aspects which still

	to predict molecular complex configurations, when unknown, as a useful
	approach to select proper anchorage architectures. Additionally,
	we deal with data acquirement and analysis, with regard to the force
	curve selection, to the force histograms interpretation, and to the
	theoretical frameworks used to extract kinetic parameters. Through
	this, we outline that AFS can be successfully used both to investigate

stronger bonds. For a loading rate beyond the upper limit of the scaling

	Abstract = "{We explore the question of whether local effects
(originating from the amino acids intrinsic secondary structure propensities)
or nonlocal effects (reflecting the sequence of amino acids as a whole) play a
larger role in determining the fold of globular proteins. Earlier circular
dichroism studies have shown that the pattern of polar, non polar amino acids
(nonlocal effect) dominates over the amino acid intrinsic propensity (local
effect) in determining the secondary structure of oligomeric peptides. In this
article, we present a coarse grained computational model that allows us to
quantitatively estimate the role of local and nonlocal factors in determining
both the secondary and tertiary structure of small, globular proteins. The
amino acid intrinsic secondary structure propensity is modeled by a dihedral
potential term. This dihedral potential is parametrized to match with
experimental measurements of secondary structure propensity. Similarly, the
magnitude of the attraction between hydrophobic residues is parametrized to
match the experimental transfer free energies of hydrophobic amino acids. Under
these parametrization conditions, we systematically explore the degree of
frustration a given polar, non polar pattern can tolerate when the secondary
structure intrinsic propensities are in opposition to it. When the parameters
are in the biophysically relevant range, we observe that the fold of small,
globular proteins is determined by the pattern of polar, non polar amino acids
regardless of their instrinsic secondary structure propensities. Our
simulations shed new light on previous observations that tertiary interactions
are more influential in determining protein structure than secondary structure
propensity. The fact that this can be inferred using a simple polymer model
that lacks most of the biochemical details points to the fundamental importance
of binary patterning in governing folding.}"

	abstract=" In the context of dynamic Monte Carlo simulations on a model protein confined
to a tetrahedral lattice, the interplay of protein size and tertiary structure,
and the requirements for an all-or-none transition to a unique native state,
are investigated. Small model proteins having a primary sequence consisting of
a central bend neutral region flanked by two tails having an alternating
hydrophobic/hydrophilic pattern of residues are seen to undergo a continuous
transition to a β-hairpin collapsed state. On increasing the length of the
tails, the β-hairpin structural motif is found to be in equilibrium with a
four-member β-barrel. Further increase of the tail length results in the shift
of the structural equilibrium to the four-member β-barrel. The random coil to
β-barrel transition is of an all-or-none character, but while the central turn
is always the desired native bend, the location of the turns involving the two
external strands is variable. That is, β-barrels having the external stands
that are two residues out of register are also observed in the transition
region. Introduction into the primary sequence of two additional regions that
are at the very least neutral toward turn formation produces an all-or-none
transition to the unique, native, four-member β-barrel. Various factors that
can augment the stability of the native conformation are explored. Overall,
these folding simulations strongly indicate that the general rules of globular
protein folding are rather robust—namely, one requires a general pattern of
hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues that allow the protein to have a welldefined
interior and exterior and the presence of regions in the amino acid sequence
that at the very least are locally indifferent to turn formation. Since no
site-specific interactions between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues are
required to produce a unique four-member β-barrel, these simulations strongly
suggest that site specificity is involved in structural fine-tuning."

the potential-energy-landscape ensemble, it is possible to make direct
connections between the geometry of the landscape and the long-time dynamical
behaviors of systems such as supercooled liquids. We show, in particular, that
the onset of slow dynamics in such systems is governed directly by the lengths
of their geodesics—the shortest paths through their landscapes within the
special ensemble. The more convoluted and labyrinthine these geodesics are, the
slower that dynamics is. Geodesics in the landscape ensemble have sufficiently
well-defined characteristics that it is straightforward to search for them
numerically, a point we illustrate by computing the geodesic lengths for an
ordinary atomic liquid and a binary glass-forming atomic mixture. We find that
the temperature dependence of the diffusion constants of these systems,
including the precipitous drop as the glass-forming system approaches its
empirical mode-coupling transition, is predicted quantitatively by the growth
of the geodesic path lengths.

Transition states are defined as points in configuration space with the highest

transition paths between reactants and products). In the high-friction
(diffusive) limit of Langevin dynamics, the resulting ensemble of transition
states is shown to coincide with the separatrix formed by points of equal
commitment (or splitting) probabilities for reaching the product and reactant
regions. Transition states according to the new criterion can be identified
directly from equilibrium trajectories, or indirectly by calculating
probability densities in the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles using
umbrella and transition-path sampling, respectively. An algorithm is proposed
to calculate rate coefficients from the transition-path and equilibrium
ensembles by estimating the frequency of transitions between reactants and

situ, titin is in close proximity to the thin filaments, we also studied
whether the PEVK domain of cardiac or skeletal titin may interact with actin
filaments. Interaction was indeed found in the an vitro motility assay, in
which recombinant PEVK titin constructs slowed down the sliding velocity of
actin filaments over myosin. Skeletal PEVK titin affected the actin sliding to
a lesser degree than cardiac PEVK titin. The cardiac PEVK effect was partially
suppressed by physiological Ca2+ concentrations, whereas the skeletal PEVK
effect was independent of {[}Ca2+]. Co-sedimentation assays confirmed the
Ca2+-modulated actin-binding propensity of cardiac PEVK titin, but did not
detect interaction between actin and skeletal PEVK titin. In myofibrils, the

captured and held in an optical trap. The DNA was subsequently stretched by
moving the coverglass with respect to the trap using a piezo-driven stage,
while the position of the bead was recorded at nanometer-scale resolution. An
electronic feedback circuit was activated to prevent bead movement beyond a
preset clamping point by modulating the light intensity, altering the trap
stiffness dynamically. This arrangement permits rapid determination of the F-x
relationship for individual DNA molecules as short as -1 micron with
unprecedented accuracy, subjected to both low (approximately 0.1 pN) and high
(approximately 50 pN) loads: complete data sets are acquired in under a minute.
Experimental F-x relationships were fit over much of their range by entropic
elasticity theories based on worm-like chain models. Fits yielded a persistence
length, Lp, of approximately 47 nm in a buffer containing 10 mM Na1.
Multivalent cations, such as Mg2+ or spermidine 3+, reduced Lp to approximately

intrinsic persistence length remains close to 40 nm. An elasticity theory
incorporating both enthalpic and entropic contributions to stiffness fit the

are encapsulated in the potential energy landscapes on which the atoms move—an
observation that suggests that the essentials of the dynamics ought to be
determined by the geometry of those landscapes. But what are the principal
geometric features that control the long-time dynamics? We suggest that the key
lies not in the local minima and saddles of the landscape, but in a more global
property of the surface: its accessible pathways. In order to make this notion
more precise we introduce two ideas: (1) a switch to a new ensemble that
deemphasizes the concept of potential barriers, and (2) a way of finding
optimum pathways within this new ensemble. The potential energy landscape
ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum
accessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control
variable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent
to the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers it allows
us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We illustrate
these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the Kob-Andersen
[Phys. Rev. E 51, 4626 (1995)] of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the
process, that the landscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a
connectivity transition at the landscape energy associated with its empirical
mode-coupling transition. We turn to the problem of finding the most efficient
pathways through potential energy landscapes in our companion paper.

title = {A growing string method for determining transition states: Comparison to the nudged elastic band and string methods},
abstract={
Interpolation methods such as the nudged elastic band and string methods are
widely used for calculating minimum energy pathways and transition states for
chemical reactions. Both methods require an initial guess for the reaction
pathway. A poorly chosen initial guess can cause slow convergence, convergence
to an incorrect pathway, or even failed electronic structure force calculations
along the guessed pathway. This paper presents a growing string method that can
find minimum energy pathways and transition states without the requirement of
an initial guess for the pathway. The growing string begins as two string
fragments, one associated with the reactants and the other with the products.
Each string fragment is grown separately until the fragments converge. Once the
two fragments join, the full string moves toward the minimum energy pathway
according to the algorithm for the string method. This paper compares the
growing string method to the string method and to the nudged elastic band
method using the alanine dipeptide rearrangement as an example. In this
example, for which the linearly interpolated guess is far from the minimum
energy pathway, the growing string method finds the saddle point with
significantly fewer electronic structure force calculations than the string
method or the nudged elastic band method.  },

exchange mechanism in Si, which is a complicated pathway for defect-free
diffusion in the diamond lattice. For surface systems, we considered ad-dimer
diffusion mechanisms on Si(100). We incorporated the climbing image extension
of the nudged elastic band method and compared it against the original approach

comparisons with related methods and the general implementation of our method,
we believe that this is well suited for efficient estimates of activation

occurring on the time scale of picoseconds, is simulated by ordinary classical
dynamics, but the time interval in between deposition events, on the order of
milliseconds, is simulated by the long time scale algorithm. The Al(100)
surface is found to grow remarkably smooth, even at 30 K because of concerted
displacements of multiple atoms with significantly lower activation energy than
adatom diffusion on the flat terrace.

Protein physics is grounded on three fundamental experimental facts: protein,
this long heteropolymer, has a well defined compact three-dimensional
structure; this structure can spontaneously arise from the unfolded protein
chain in appropriate environment; and this structure is separated from the
unfolded state of the chain by the "all-or-none" phase transition, which
ensures robustness of protein structure and therefore of its action. The aim of
this review is to consider modern understanding of physical principles of
self-organization of protein structures and to overview such important features
of this process, as finding out the unique protein structure among zillions
alternatives, nucleation of the folding process and metastable folding
intermediates. Towards this end we will consider the main experimental facts
and simple, mostly phenomenological theoretical models. We will concentrate on
relatively small (single-domain) water-soluble globular proteins (whose
structure and especially folding are much better studied and understood than
those of large or membrane and fibrous proteins) and consider kinetic and
structural aspects of transition of initially unfolded protein chains into
their final solid ("native") 3D structures." }

The problem of how a protein chain can find its most stable structure without
exhaustive sorting of all its possible conformations is known as the
[`]Levinthal paradox'. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate this problem
and to estimate the rate of folding to the most stable structure near the point
of thermodynamic equilibrium between this structure and the coil.Results
Folding is rapid when it occurs in the vicinity of a thermodynamic
[`]all-or-none' transition from the coil to the lowest-energy fold: here the
misfolded and semifolded states cannot [`]trap' the folding chain since, even
taken together, all these states are less stable than both the initial coil and
the final stable fold of the chain. A stable globular structure can be rapidly
achieved via a [`]nucleation-and-growth' folding pathway that provides a
continuous entropy-by-energy compensation along the folding pathway and thus
provides a low free energy of the transition state.Conclusion At the point of
transition of the coil to the lowest-energy fold, an N-residue chain folds
normally in ~exp(N2/3) ns. Therefore, a 100-residue chain finds its most stable
fold within minutes rather than in 10100 ps [approximate] 1080 years, according
to the famous paradoxical estimate of Levinthal." }

title = {Optimization methods for finding minimum energy paths},
abstract={ A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum
energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an
initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare
the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and
simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our
results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the
most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer.
The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse
Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a
climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP
with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is
found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use
a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise
Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and
plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion
mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and
diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

abstract={
Three new algorithms are presented for determining transition state (TS)
structures on the reduced potential energy surface, that is, for problems in
which a few important degrees of freedom can be isolated. All three methods use
constrained optimization to rapidly find the TS without an initial Hessian
evaluation. The algorithms highlight how efficiently the TS can be located on a
reduced surface, where the rest of the degrees of freedom are minimized. The
first method uses a nonpositive definite quasi-Newton update for the reduced
degrees of freedom. The second uses Shepard interpolation to fit the Hessian
and starts from a set of points that bound the TS. The third directly uses a
finite difference scheme to calculate the reduced degrees of freedom of the
Hessian of the entire system, and searches for the TS on the full potential
energy surface. All three methods are tested on an epoxide hydrolase cluster,
and the ring formations of cyclohexane and cyclobutenone. The results indicate
that all the methods are able to converge quite rapidly to the correct TS, but
that the finite difference approach is the most efficient.}

the standard 50-dimensional analytic Rosenbrock function. Results are also

the optimal planar dividing surface for multidimensional dissipative systems

generalized to include the effect of nonlinearities in the system potential.
Consideration of the optimal planar dividing surface leads to a unified
treatment of a variety of problems. These are (a) extension of the
Kramers–Grote–Hynes theory for the transmission coefficient to include finite

dynamical simulations of C60, involves a multi-step isomerization transition

step-to-step energy barriers found in the multistep process are much lower than
the reported ones for single-setp process. We also present a dynamical
simulation of the thermal fullerene-to-graphite reconstruction of C60 of
relevance to the growth of fullerenes. The two thermal processes presented open
new roads for investigating the formation and annealing mechanisms of different
carbon structures." }

abstract={ We report the first successful molecular dynamics simulations of
fullerene annealing and fragmentation. The molecular vibrational dynamics,
which we find to play a central role in these processes, is simulated by
following constant energy trajectories under specially generated initial
conditions. Employing this scheme with a carbon tight-binding potential, we
have observed sequential C2 loss from C60, as well as the rearrangement of
carbon-carbon bonds on the fullerene cage. Our successful approach is a
departure from previously employed constant temperature schemes.

There are many stable C60 structures other than the icosahedral one proposed by
Kroto, Heath, O'Brien, Curl and Smalley. They are related to each other by
transformations involving the movement of two atoms. These transformations are
thermally forbidden in the Woodward-Hoffmann sense (though photochemically
allowed) and the observed C60 mass peak is likely to arise from a mixture of
isomers." }

nudged” DNEB method is analyzed in conjunction with both minimizers and
compared with previous NEB formulations. We find that the fastest DNEB approach
(DNEB/L-BFGS) can be quicker by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Applications to
permutational rearrangements of the seven-atom Lennard-Jones cluster (LJ7) and
highly cooperative rearrangements of LJ38 and LJ75 are presented. We also
outline an updated algorithm for constructing complicated multi-step pathways

Abstract = {{We report a new algorithm for constructing pathways between local
   minima that involve a large number of intervening transition states on
   the potential energy surface. A significant improvement in efficiency
   has been achieved by changing the strategy for choosing successive
   pairs of local minima that serve as endpoints for the next search. We
   employ Dijkstra's algorithm {[}E. W. Dijkstra, Numer. Math. 1, 269
   (1959)] to identify the ``shortest{''} path corresponding to missing
   connections within an evolving database of local minima and the
   transition states that connect them. The metric employed to determine
   the shortest missing connection is a function of the minimized
   Euclidean distance. We present applications to the formation of
   buckminsterfullerene and to the folding of various biomolecules: the B1
   domain of protein G, tryptophan zippers, and the villin headpiece
   subdomain. The corresponding pathways contain up to 163 transition
   states and will be used in future discrete path sampling calculations.

abstract ={We present two methods to probe the energy landscape and motions of
proteins in the context of molecular dynamics simulations of the helix-forming
S-peptide of RNase A and the RNase A-3'-UMP enzyme-product complex. The first
method uses the generalized ergodic measure to compute the rate of
conformational space sampling. Using the dynamics of nonbonded forces as a
means of probing the time scale for ergodicity to be obtained, we argue that
even in a relatively short time (< 10 psec) several different conformational
substrates are sampled. At longer times, barriers on the order of a few
kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184 J) are involved in the large-scale motion of proteins.
We also present an approximate method for evaluating the distribution of
barrier heights g(EB) using the instantaneous normal-mode spectra of a protein.
For the S-peptide, we show that g(EB) is adequately represented by a Poisson
distribution. By comparing with previous work on other systems, we suggest that
the statistical characteristics of the energy landscape may be a "universal"
feature of all proteins.}, URL =

abstract ={Initiation of protein folding by light can dramatically improve the
time resolution of kinetic studies. Here we present an example of an optically
triggered folding reaction by using nanosecond photodissociation of the
heme-carbon monoxide complex of reduced cytochrome c. The optical trigger is
based on the observation that under destabilizing conditions cytochrome c can
be unfolded by preferential binding of carbon monoxide to the covalently
attached heme group in the unfolded state. Photodissociation of the carbon
monoxide thus triggers the folding reaction. We used time-resolved absorption
spectroscopy to monitor binding at the heme. Before folding begins we observe
transient binding of both nonnative and native ligands from the unfolded
polypeptide on a microsecond time scale. Kinetic modeling suggests that the
intramolecular binding of methionine-65 and -80 is faster than that of
histidine-26 and -33, even though the histidines are closer to the heme. This
optical trigger should provide a powerful method for studying chain collapse
and secondary structure formation in cytochrome c without any limitations in
time resolution.}, URL = {http://www.pnas.org/content/90/24/11860.abstract},

collapse cooperativity is driven by nonlocal interactions, causes sheet and
irregular conformations in addition to helices, leads to secondary structures
concurrently with early hydrophobic core formation, is much more sequence
dependent than helix-coil processes, and involves compact intermediate states
that have much secondary-but little tertiary-structure. Hydrophobic contacts in
the 1992 Protein Data Bank have the type of `'topological localness'' predicted
by the hypothesis. The HZ paths for amino acid sequences that mimic crambin and
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor are quickly found by computer; the best
configurations thus reached have single hydrophobic cores that are within about
3 kcal/mol of the global minimum. This hypothesis shows how proteins could find
globally optimal states without exhaustive search.}", Publisher = "{NATL ACAD

abstract={
We study the folding dynamics of short two‐dimensional self‐avoiding lattice
model proteins and copolymers with specific HP sequences (H, hydrophobic, P,
polar) that fold to unique native structures. HH contacts are favorable. The
conformational landscape is found by exhaustive enumeration using two different
move sets, and time evolution is modeled by a transition matrix with the
Metropolis criterion. The kinetic sequence of folding events depends strongly
on both the monomer sequence and on the move set. But certain features are
common to all sequences with both move sets. Beginning with open conformations,
chains fold through multiple paths, are slowed by kinetic traps, and accumulate
in compact nonnative conformations. Most chains must surmount energy barriers,
which we identify as the transition state. Strikingly, the transition state
involves a chain expansion, due to the breaking of HH contacts of compact
denatured conformations. Mutations can significantly affect the energy
landscape and folding dynamics, but in ways that appear too subtle to predict
just from knowledge of native structures. Consistent with other models, we find
that sequences with a large energy gap between the native and the next higher
energy level can be stable and fold rapidly }

forced unfolding pathway of a titin immunoglobulin domain, TI 127. TNfn3 and TI
127 are members of different protein superfamilies and have no sequence
identity but they have the same P-sandwich structure consisting of two
antiparallel beta-sheets. TNfn3, however, unfolds at significantly lower forces
than TI 127. We compare the response of these proteins to mechanical force.
Mutational analysis shows that, as is the case with TI 127, TNfn3 unfolds via a
force-stabilised ihtermediate. The key event in forced unfolding in TI 127 is
largely the breaking of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the
A' and G-strands. The mechanical (D-value analysis and molecular dynamics
simulations reported here reveal that significantly more of the TNfn3 molecule
contributes to its resistance to force. Both AFM experimental data and
molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the rate-limiting step of TNfn3
forced unfolding reflects a transition from the extended early intermediate to
an aligned intermediate state. As well as losses of interactions of the A and
G-strands and associated loops there are rearrangements throughout the core. As
was the case for TI 127, the forced unfolding pathway of TNfn3 is different
from that observed in denaturant studies in the absence of force. (c) 2005

We investigate the role that local conformational tendencies can have in
  guiding the folding of helical proteins, using simple statistical mechanical
  models. The theory provides a synthesis of classical models of the helix-coil
  transition in polymers with an approximate treatment of the effects of
  excluded volume, confinement, and packing alignment of the helices based on a
  free energy function. The theory studies the consequences of signals encoded
  locally in the sequence as stabilization energies associated with three types
  of local structure: native helical conformations, native non-helical
  conformations, and native helix caps or start-stop signals. The role of
  randomness in the energies of conformations due to tertiary interactions is
  also studied vis-à-vis the difficulty of conformational search. The thermal
  behavior of the model is presented for realistic values of the conformational
  signal energies, which can be estimated from experimental studies on peptide
  fragments. Estimates are made for the relative contribution of local signals
  and specific tertiary interactions to the folding stability gap.  }

The relationship between collapse and tertiary structure formation, and the
order of collapse and secondary structure formation, are investigated. We find
that the initial collapse process gives rise to a transition state with about
30% of the native tertiary structure and 50–70% of the native helix content. We
also observe two distinct distributions of native helix in this collapsed state
(Rg ≈ 12 Å), one with about 20% of the native helical hydrogen bonds, the other
with near 70%. The former corresponds to a local minimum. The barrier from this
metastable state to the native state is about 2 kBT. In the latter case,
folding is essentially a downhill process involving topological assembly. In
addition, the order of formation of secondary structure among the three helices
is examined. We observe cooperative formation of the secondary structure in
helix I and helix II. Secondary structure in helix III starts to form following
the formation of certain secondary structure in both helix I and helix II.
Comparisons of our results with those from theory and experiment are made.},

Abstract = {{The statistical mechanics of polypeptide folding are studied by Monte
   Carlo simulations on a lattice protein model. Effective sampling of the
   protein conformations over the folding transition is achieved by an
   entropy sampling procedure, combined with a stochastically biased
   conformation-generating scheme and a jump-walking algorithm.
   Comparative analyses are carried out for optimally designed sequences
   and randomly selected sequences in terms of four properties: (a) the
   thermal folding/unfolding transitions of the different sequences; (b)
   the distributions of conformational populations at the corresponding
   transition temperatures of the sequences; (c) the fitting of the
   simulation results to an analytical theory; and (d) the distributions
   of local energy minima and the energy barriers between them in
   different conformational regions. It is found that all the polypeptides
   studied here exhibit rather sharp transitions at their folding
   temperatures. However, the designed/optimized sequences exhibit
   long-range cooperative behavior in the folding transition, while the
   random sequences reflect only short-range (i.e., nearest-neighbor)
   cooperative phenomena. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimized
   sequences fold to unique lowest-energy structures, but that the random
   sequences, when cooled, fold to compact but in general random
   structures. This study demonstrates that whether or not a polypeptide
   folds to the lowest-energy structure can be determined from its
   sequence by statistical mechanical characteristics. The implication of
   biological evolution in determining protein sequences is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the statistical mechanical properties are investigated of
   a simple analytical model which is based loosely on a cluster of atoms.
   The model has a phase transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like
   phase. Particular interest is paid to the dependence of the nature of
   this phase transition on the number of degrees of freedom. As expected
   the transition becomes sharper as the number of degrees of freedom
   increases. The phase properties of the model are discussed conveniently
   in terms of Landau functions. In the canonical ensemble the relevant
   function is the Landau free energy F(Q, T), a function of the order
   parameter Q and the temperature T. The corresponding function in a
   microcanonical ensemble is minus the Landau entropy, a function of the
   order parameter and total energy. These functions can, in general, be
   calculated from probability distributions which are available from
   simulations. In both cases stable or metastable phases correspond to
   valleys in the function; continuous transitions to merging valleys and
   first-order phase changes to valleys separated by barriers. The N
   dependence of the Landau functions per degree of freedom is very weak,
   so that the best criterion for determining the order of a phase
   transition, which is valid for large and small systems, is the presence
   or absence of a barrier in the relevant Landau function. The limits of
   metastability of phases occur at the heads of the valleys in the Landau
   functions. It is shown that these can be related to the properties of
   the system in the potential ensemble. The model exhibits a region of
   negative specific heat (i.e., an S-band in the caloric curve) in the
   microcanonical ensemble which becomes vanishingly small in the limit of
   large N. Finally, the relation of these results to other proposed
   criteria for the limits of metastability of solid phases is discussed.}},

We propose a general-purpose method for finding high-quality solutions to hard
optimization problems, inspired by self-organizing processes often found in
nature. The method, called Extremal Optimization, successively eliminates
extremely undesirable components of sub-optimal solutions. Drawing upon models
used to simulate far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it complements approximation
methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as Simulated
Annealing. With only one adjustable parameter, its performance proves
competitive with, and often superior to, more elaborate stochastic optimization
procedures. We demonstrate it here on two classic hard optimization problems:
graph partitioning and the traveling salesman problem." }

techniques. The approach is very general and flexible and is illustrated here

convergence to the global minimum than previous approaches.

Abstract = {{We model the kinetic processes by which globular proteins and other
   heteropolymers fold to compact states. We perform Monte Carlo dynamics
   simulations on short self-avoiding copolymer chains on two-dimensional
   square lattices. The driving force for collapse is the aversion of
   nonpolar monomers for water. The chain monomers are of two types, H and
   P; favorable interactions occur among HH contacts. One respect in which
   this study differs from previous Monte Carlo folding studies is that
   the chains are sufficiently short that: (i) we can know unequivocally
   which conformations are at global minima (the ``native{''} states) and
   which are at local minima of free energy, (ii) we can explore ``pathway
   space{''} densely to determine the relative probabilities of all the
   possible pathways, and thus we establish that the model is ergodic and
   gives the equilibrium distribution in the long-time limit. We find that
   any individual molecule passes through a wide range of conformational
   states, often many times. Nevertheless, this meandering is not
   inconsistent with the observation that proteins fold through specific
   pathways involving particular sequences of events. Some pathways are
   strongly favored; i.e., folding is ``cooperative{''} in that a
   ``nucleating{''} HH contact acts as a constraint that restricts local
   conformational freedom and speeds the ``zipping up{''} of other
   contacts nearby. Which pathways are favored depends on the sequence and
   the solvent. How does a chain fold to its native state so quickly? For
   these short chains of fixed length, we observe three regimes of folding
   kinetics. In the ``Levinthal limit,{''} as the HH attraction approaches
   zero, folding is slow because the molecule searches randomly through
   the large ensemble of open conformations. In the ``multiple minima{''}
   limit, when the HH attraction is very strong, folding is also slow
   because the chain becomes stuck in local minima of wrong compact
   conformations. However, we find that folding is relatively fast for
   intermediate HH attraction because the driving force ``directs{''} the
   molecule toward a small ensemble of compact states, and yet incorrect
   potential wells are not too deep to slow this process.}},

Abstract = {{The number of all possible conformations of a polypeptide chain is too
   large to be sampled exhaustively. Nevertheless, protein sequences do
   fold into unique native states in seconds (the Levinthal paradox). To
   determine how the Levinthal parades is resolved, we use a lattice Monte
   Carlo model in which the global minimum (native state) is known. The
   necessary and sufficient condition for folding in this model is that
   the native state be a pronounced global minimum on the potential
   surface. This guarantees thermodynamic stability of the native state at
   a temperature where the chain does not get trapped in local minima.
   Folding starts by a rapid collapse from a random-coil state to a random
   semi-compact globule. It then proceeds by a slow, rate-determining
   search through the semicompact states to find a transition state from
   which the chain folds rapidly to the native state. The elements of the
   folding mechanism that lead to the resolution of the Levinthal parades
   are the reduced number of conformations that need to be searched in the
   semicompact globule (similar to 10(10) versus similar to 10(16) for the
   random coil) and the existence of many (similar to 10(3)) transition
   states. The results have evolutionary implications and suggest
   principles for the folding of real proteins.}},

The elastic properties of single stranded (ss)DNA, studied by pulling on an
isolated molecule, are shown to agree with a recent model of ssDNA that takes
into account base pairings and screened electrostatic repulsion of the
phosphodiester backbone. By an appropriate physicochemical treatment, the
pairing interactions were suppressed and ssDNA used as an experimental model
for a generic polyelectrolyte. The elastic behavior of such an altered ssDNA
deviates strongly from the behavior of an ideal polymer. This deviation is
shown to result from the elasticity of the chain and its electrostatic
self-avoiding interactions.  }

Here we combine single-molecule electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy
to examine the conformations of the human cardiac titin PEVK region. In
contrast to a simple random coil, we have found that cardiac PEVK shows a wide
range of elastic conformations with end-to-end distances ranging from 9 to 24
nm and persistence lengths from 0.4 to 2.5 nm. Individual PEVK molecules
retained their distinctive elastic conformations through many
stretch-relaxation cycles, consistent with the view that these PEVK conformers
cannot be interconverted by force. The multiple elastic conformations of
cardiac PEVK may result from varying degrees of proline isomerization. The
single-molecule techniques demonstrated here may help elucidate the
conformation of other proteins that lack a well-defined structure.}, URL =

    Is the mechanical unraveling of protein domains by atomic force microscopy

	By engineering a protein made of tandem repeats of identical Ig modules,

	force. We compare this with chemical unfolding rates for untethered

	for unfolding appears at the same position on the folding pathway

properties and it allows for a direct investigation of the mechanisms ruling
the approach towards the native configuration. The results reported in this
paper have been obtained fora two-dimensional toy-model of aminoacid sequences,
whosenative configurations were previously determined byMonte Carlo
techniques.The somewhat controversial scenario emerging from the comparison
among different thermodynamical indicators is definitely better resolved with
the help of a truly dynamical description. In particular,we are able to
identify the metastable states visited during the folding process by monitoring
the temporal evolution of the `long-range' potentialenergy. Moreover, the
resulting dynamical scenario is consistent with the picture arising from a
reconstruction of the energy landscape in the vicinity of the global minimum.
This suggests that the introduction of efficient `static' indicators too should
properly account for the complex `orography' of the landscape.},

We investigate the mechanical unfolding of the tenth type III domain from
fibronectin (FnIII10) both at constant force and at constant pulling velocity,
by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. We observe both apparent two-state
unfolding and several unfolding pathways involving one of three major, mutually
exclusive intermediate states. All three major intermediates lack two of seven
native [beta]-strands, and share a quite similar extension. The unfolding
behavior is found to depend strongly on the pulling conditions. In particular,
we observe large variations in the relative frequencies of occurrence for the
intermediates. At low constant force or low constant velocity, all three major
intermediates occur with a significant frequency. At high constant force or
high constant velocity, one of them, with the N- and C-terminal [beta]-strands
detached, dominates over the other two. Using the extended Jarzynski equality,
we also estimate the equilibrium free-energy landscape, calculated as a
function of chain extension. The application of a constant pulling force leads
to a free-energy profile with three major local minima. Two of these correspond
to the native and fully unfolded states, respectively, whereas the third one
can be associated with the major unfolding intermediates."

abstract={ The 38-atom Lennard-Jones cluster has a paradigmatic double-funnel
energy landscape. One funnel ends in the global minimum, a face-centered-cubic
(fcc) truncated octahedron. At the bottom of the other funnel is the second
lowest energy minimum which is an incomplete Mackay icosahedron. We
characterize the energy landscape in two ways. First, from a large sample of
minima and transition states we construct a disconnectivity graph showing which
minima are connected below certain energy thresholds. Second, we compute the
free energy as a function of a bond-order parameter. The free energy profile
has two minima, one which corresponds to the fcc funnel and the other which at
low temperature corresponds to the icosahedral funnel and at higher
temperatures to the liquidlike state. These two approaches show that the
greater width of the icosahedral funnel, and the greater structural similarity
between the icosahedral structures and those associated with the liquidlike
state, are the cause of the smaller free energy barrier for entering the
icosahedral funnel from the liquidlike state and therefore of the cluster’s
preferential entry into this funnel on relaxation down the energy landscape.
Furthermore, the large free energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral
funnels, which is energetic in origin, causes the cluster to be trapped in one
of the funnels at low temperature. These results explain in detail the link
between the double-funnel energy landscape and the difficulty of global
optimization for this cluster.  }

abstract={ By analyzing the dynamics of model potential energy surfaces we
systematically investigate the processes involved in passing from a high energy
state to the global minimum and how the probability of reaching the global
minimum depends upon the topography and topology of the potential energy
surface (PES). Relaxation to the global minimum is easiest for PES’s consisting
of a single funnel (a set of convergent pathways which lead to the global
minimum) with low barriers and a significant potential energy gradient towards
the global minimum. The presence of additional funnels on the surface can
severely reduce the rate of relaxation to the global minimum. Such secondary
funnels act most efficiently as kinetic traps when they terminate at a low
energy minimum, have a steep potential energy gradient and are wide (i.e., have
a large configurational entropy) compared to the primary funnel. Indeed, it is
even possible to construct PES's for which the system relaxes to the minimum at
the bottom of a secondary funnel rather than the global minimum and then
remains in this metastable state over a long time scale. Our results for these
model PES’s are discussed in the context of theoretical and experimental
knowledge of the dynamics of proteins, clusters, and glasses.

  abstract={
The early description of the living cell as a reaction vessel of molecules
undergoing random collisions has evolved to a much more interesting picture of
a small chemical factory of complex and dynamic molecular structures that carry
out specialized functions in a highly-coordinated fashion. Traditional solution
biochemistry has had extraordinary success in elucidating molecular structures
of the cellular components. The task of capturing the dynamics and the
distribution of states of these structures, however, seemed nearly impossible
because the activities of the molecules in the solution are asynchronous as the
result of their interactions with the surroundings. This situation has changed
with the development of single-molecule biophysical methods (1, 2) that permit
measurements of the response of macromolecules or individual molecular bonds to
external load with the spectacular resolution of subnanometer distances and
picoNewton forces, revealing details that are typically lost to ensemble
averaging when studied by solution methods. Unprecedented information about the
mechanisms that drive biological processes becomes encoded in the resulting
wealth of unaveraged data. Recall, however, that these systems are of
microscopic dimensions, which puts thermal fluctuations on equal footing with
the external deterministic forces. This circumstance, along with the far from
equilibrium conditions, makes a quantitative description of the molecular bond
properties that can account for observed data a challenging task. The article
by Freund in this issue of PNAS (3) offers a theoretical framework that does
just that. A novel and concise derivation takes the reader from a very
fundamental starting point to a set of analytical results that provide
intriguing insights into the response of a molecular bond to an imposed
mechanical load.

“statistical temperature molecular dynamics” (STMD) [ J. Kim et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 97, 050601 (2006) ], which combines ingredients of multicanonical
molecular dynamics and Wang-Landau sampling. Exploiting the relation between
the statistical temperature and the density of states, STMD generates a flat
energy distribution and efficient sampling with a dynamic update of the
statistical temperature, transforming an initial constant estimate to the true
statistical temperature T(U), with U being the potential energy. Here, the
performance of STMD is examined in the Lennard-Jones fluid with diverse
simulation conditions, and in the coarse-grained, off-lattice BLN 46-mer and
69-mer protein models, exhibiting rugged potential energy landscapes with a
high degree of frustration. STMD simulations combined with inherent structure
(IS) analysis allow an accurate determination of protein thermodynamics down to
very low temperatures, overcoming quasiergodicity, and illuminate the
transitions occurring in folding in terms of the energy landscape. It is found
that a thermodynamic signature of folding is significantly suppressed by
accurate sampling, due to an incoherent contribution from low-lying non-native
IS in multifunneled landscapes. It is also shown that preferred accessibility
to such IS during the collapse transition is intimately related to misfolding
or poor foldability

determination of 239 199 IS states, believed to encompass nearly all the
compact, low-energy states, and of well-averaged thermodynamic quantities at
low temperature. The density of states shows distinct lobes for compact and
extended states, and entropic barriers for the collapse and local ordering
transitions. A two-dimensional scatterplot or density of states clearly shows
the multifunnel structure of the energy landscape. The anharmonic vibrational
free energy is found to play a crucial role in protein folding. The problem of
determining the folding transition in a multifunnel system is discussed, and
novel indicators of folding are introduced. A particularly clear picture is
obtained through the occupation probabilities, pi, of individual low-lying IS,

A simulation method is presented that achieves a flat energy distribution by
updating the statistical temperature instead of the density of states in
Wang-Landau sampling. A novel molecular dynamics algorithm (STMD) applicable to
complex systems and a Monte Carlo algorithm are developed from this point of
view. Accelerated convergence for large energy bins, essential for large
systems, is demonstrated in tests on the Ising model, the Lennard-Jones fluid,
and bead models of proteins. STMD shows a superior ability to find local minima
in proteins and new global minima are found for the 55 bead AB model in two and
three dimensions. Calculations of the occupation probabilities of individual
protein inherent structures provide new insights into folding and misfolding.

  abstract={ 
In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell interfaces arise
mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds will fail under any
level of pulling force if held for sufficient time. Thus, when tested with
ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength
of adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent properties. To
examine what can be learned from measurements of bond strength, we have
extended Kramers' theory for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation
under force and tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics)
simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force that
produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage, i.e., the
peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by the simulations,
theory shows that bond strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of
loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading (> or
= 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent enough to keep the
distribution peak at zero force. In the slow-loading regime immediately above
the critical rate, strength grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects
initial coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is
crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the
logarithm of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of
attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of
molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly overwhelmed by
the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked frictional drag on the
structure remains to retard separation. Hence, to expose the energy landscape
that governs bond strength, molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an
enormous span of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the
time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast
scale of molecular motions. Using results from a simulation of biotin-avidin
bonds (Izrailev, S., S. Stepaniants, M. Balsera, Y. Oono, and K. Schulten.

in atomic force microscope and optical tweezer experiments to partially depend
on the reversible unfolding of individual Ig domains. We performed steered
molecular dynamics simulations to stretch single titin Ig domains in solution
with pulling speeds of 0.5 and 1.0Å/ps. Resulting force-extension profiles
exhibit a single dominant peak for each Ig domain unfolding, consistent with
the experimentally observed sequential, as opposed to concerted, unfolding of
Ig domains under external stretching forces. This force peak can be attributed
to an initial burst of backbone hydrogen bonds, which takes place between
antiparallel β-strands A and B and between parallel β-strands A′ and G.
Additional features of the simulations, including the position of the force
peak and relative unfolding resistance of different Ig domains, can be related

Steered molecular dynamics (SMD), a computer simulation method for studying
force-induced reactions in biopolymers, has been applied to investigate the
response of protein domains to stretching apart of their terminal ends. The
simulations mimic atomic force microscopy and optical tweezer experiments, but
proceed on much shorter time scales. The simulations on different domains for
0.6 nanosecond each reveal two types of protein responses: the first type,
arising in certain β-sandwich domains, exhibits nanosecond unfolding only after
a force above 1,500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a wider class of
protein domain structures, requires significantly weaker forces for nanosecond
unfolding. In the first case, strong forces are needed to concertedly break a
set of interstrand hydrogen bonds which protect the domains against unfolding
through stretching; in the second case, stretching breaks backbone hydrogen
bonds one by one, and does not require strong forces for this purpose.
Stretching of β-sandwich (immunoglobulin) domains has been investigated further
revealing a specific relationship between response to mechanical strain and the

immunoglobulin domain I27 unfolding led to the discovery of a significant
potential energy barrier at an extension of ∼14Å on the unfolding pathway that
protects the domain against stretching. Previous simulations showed that this
barrier is due to the concurrent breaking of six interstrand hydrogen bonds
(H-bonds) between β-strands A′ and G that is preceded by the breaking of two to
three hydrogen bonds between strands A and B, the latter leading to an
unfolding intermediate. The simulation results are supported by
Ångstrom-resolution atomic force microscopy data. Here we perform a structural
and energetic analysis of the H-bonds breaking. It is confirmed that H-bonds
between strands A and B break rapidly. However, the breaking of the H-bond
between strands A′ and G needs to be assisted by fluctuations of water
molecules. In nanosecond simulations, water molecules are found to repeatedly
interact with the protein backbone atoms, weakening individual interstrand
H-bonds until all six A′–G H-bonds break simultaneously under the influence of
external stretching forces. Only when those bonds are broken can the generic
unfolding take place, which involves hydrophobic interactions of the protein
core and exerts weaker resistance against stretching than the key event.

We report molecular dynamics simulations that induce, over periods of 40-500
ps, the unbinding of biotin from avidin by means of external harmonic forces
with force constants close to those of AFM cantilevers. The applied forces are
sufficiently large to reduce the overall binding energy enough to yield
unbinding within the measurement time. Our study complements earlier work on
biotin-streptavidin that employed a much larger harmonic force constant. The
simulations reveal a variety of unbinding pathways, the role of key residues
contributing to adhesion as well as the spatial range over which avidin binds
biotin. In contrast to the previous studies, the calculated rupture forces
exceed by far those observed. We demonstrate, in the framework of models
expressed in terms of one-dimensional Langevin equations with a schematic
binding potential, the associated Smoluchowski equations, and the theory of
first passage times, that picosecond to nanosecond simulation of ligand
unbinding requires such strong forces that the resulting protein-ligand motion
proceeds far from the thermally activated regime of millisecond AFM
experiments, and that simulated unbinding cannot be readily extrapolated to the
experimentally observed rupture." }

	The second capsule without adhesion molecules is pressurized into
	a spherical shape with low suction by another pipette. This capsule
	is maneuvered to initiate point contact at the pole opposite the
	stiff capsule which leads to formation of a few (or even one) molecular

	displacement of the pipette. Analysis shows that the end-to-end extension
	of the capsule provides a direct measure of the force at the point
	contact and, therefore, the rupture strength when detachment occurs.
	The range for point forces accessible to this technique depends on
	the elastic moduli of the membrane, membrane tension, and the size
	of the capsule. For biological and synthetic vesicle membranes, the
	range of force lies between 10(-7)-10(-5) dyn (10(-12)-10(-10) N)

	of the measurements and analysis was that the forces deduced for
	short-time failure of 1-2 molecular attachments were nearly the same
	for all of the agglutinin, i.e., 1-2 x 10(-6) dyn. Hence, microfluorometric
	tests were carried out to determine if labeled agglutinins and/or

We consider the rupture dynamics of a homopolymer chain pulled at one end at
a constant loading rate r.  Compared to single bond breaking, the existence of
the chain introduces two aspects into rupture dynamics: The non-Markovian
aspect in the barrier crossing and the slow down of the force propagation to
the breakable bond. The relative impact of both these processes is
investigated, and the second one was found to be the most important at moderate
loading rates. The most probable rupture force is found to decrease with the
number of bonds as f max κ −͓ln͑const N / r͔͒2/3 and finally to approach a
saturation value independent on N. All of our analytical findings are confirmed
by extensive numerical simulations.

corresponds to a minimum of a smooth function on a space of internal variables

phenomenological. Some attention is given to the question of why these seem to

potentials are not overly rugged, thereby suggesting their landscapes are like
those of actual proteins. In the present contribution we show how basin-hopping
global optimization can identify low-lying minima for the corresponding mildly
frustrated energy landscapes. For small systems the basin-hopping algorithm
succeeds in locating both lower minima and conformations closer to the
experimental structure than does molecular dynamics with simulated annealing.
For large systems the efficiency of basin-hopping decreases for our initial
implementation, where the steps consist of random perturbations to the
Cartesian coordinates. We implemented umbrella sampling using basin-hopping to
further confirm when the global minima are reached. We have also improved the
energy surface by employing bioinformatic techniques for reducing the roughness
or variance of the energy surface. Finally, the basin-hopping calculations have
guided improvements in the excluded volume of the Hamiltonian, producing better
structures. These results suggest a novel and transferable optimization scheme

conformational sampling of 2 globular proteins, protein G and src SH3 domain

topological properties of folding networks, and folding dynamics. The projected
energy surfaces of globular proteins were funneled in the vicinity of the
native but also have other quite deep, accessible minima, whereas the
randomized peptides have many local basins, including some leading to seriously
misfolded forms. Dynamics in the denatured part of the network exhibited
basin-hopping itinerancy among many conformations, whereas the protein reached
relatively well-defined final stages that led to their native states. We also

	The Jarzynski equality provides a powerful free-energy difference

	related to free-energy perturbation, a common computational technique
	for estimating free-energy differences. Despite the many applications
	of the Jarzynski estimator, its behavior is only poorly understood.
	In this article we derive the large N limit for the Jarzynski estimator
	bias, variance, and mean square error that is correct for arbitrary
	perturbations. We then analyze the properties of the Jarzynski estimator
	for all N when the probability distribution of work values is Gaussian,

	us to quantitatively compare it to two other free-energy difference
	estimators: the mean work estimator and the fluctuation-dissipation

	are studied using Langevin simulations. We use a three-letter minimal
	off-lattice representation of a de novo designed four-helix bundle
	protein. The native state of the model, which can be thought of as
	an alpha-carbon representation of the peptide chain, is a caricature
	of the sequence designed by Ho and Degrado and shows several characteristics
	found in the naturally occurring four-helix bundles. These include
	the structural aspects and the relative stability of the native conformation.
	The model four-helix bundle shows two characteristic temperatures
	T theta and Tf. The former is the temperature above which the structure
	resembles that of the random coil. Below the first-order folding
	transition temperature Tf the chain adopts the native conformation
	corresponding to the four-helix bundle. It is shown that in order
	to obtain a unique native structure a proper free energy balance
	between secondary and tertiary interactions is needed. The thermal
	denaturation starting from the unique native conformation indicates
	that at least a three-state analysis is required. The intermediates
	in the equilibrium thermal denaturation are all found to be native-like.
	The kinetics of refolding starting from an ensemble of denatured
	states shows that the acquisition of the native conformation takes
	place via a kinetic partitioning mechanism. A fraction of molecules,
	phi, reaches the native state by a topology inducing nucleation collapse
	mechanism, while the remainder (1-phi) follows a complex three-stage
	multipathway process. We suggest, in accord with our earlier studies,
	that phi is essentially determined by the intrinsic temperature scales
	T theta and Tf. Our studies indicate that better design of proteins
	can be achieved by making T theta as close to Tf as possible. Experimental
	implications for de novo design of proteins are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The kinetics and thermodynamics of protein folding is investigated
	using low friction Langevin 
	simulation ofminimal continuum models ofproteins. We show that the
	model protein has two 
	characteristic temperatures: (a) T_theta, at which the chain undergoes
	a collapse transition from an 
	extended conformation; (b) T_f (< T_theta), at which a finite size
	first-order transition to the folded 
	state takes place. The kinetics of approach to the native state from
	initially denatured conformations is probed by several novel correlation functions. We 
	find that the overall kinetics of approach to the native conformation
	occurs via a three-stage multiple pathway mechanism. The 
	initial stage, characterized by a series of local dihedral angle transitions,
	eventually results in 
	the compaction ofthe protein. Subsequently, the molecule acquires
	native-like structures during 
	the second stage offolding. The final stage of folding 
	involves activated transitions from one of 
	the native-like structures to the native conformation. The first two
	stages are characterized by a 
	multiplicity of pathways while relatively few paths are involved in
	the final stage. A detailed 
	analysis of the dynamics of individual trajectories reveals a novel
	picture of protein folding. We find that a fraction of 
	the initial population reaches the native conformation
	without the formation of any detectable intermediates. This pathway is associated with
	a nucleation mechanism, 
	i.e., once a critical number oftertiary contacts are established then
	the native state is reached 
	rapidly. The remainingfraction of molecules become trapped in misfolded
	structures (stabilized 
	by incorrect tertiary contacts). The slow folding involves transitions
	over barriers from these 
	structures to the native conformation. The theoretical predictions
	are compared with recent 
	experiments that probe protein folding kinetics by hydrogen exchange
	labeling technique.},

Single-molecule mechanical pulling experiments provide a powerful tool
for probing the energy landscape of protein folding and may reveal features
hidden in conventional bulk folding experiments. We have used 
coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate how the unfolding mechanism of
protein G varies with the magnitude and direction of applied pulling forces.
We find that pulling along mechanically “strong” coordinates gives rise to a
sudden and discrete transition in unfolding mechanism, while pulling along
mechanically weak coordinates induces more subtle and continuous shifts in
the unfolding mechanism. We present a method of analysing these shifts
in mechanism by statistical clustering of trajectories based on the order in
which individual contacts dissociate during unfolding. Projection onto the
fraction of native contacts and the pulling coordinate provides another means
of studying shifts in unfolding mechanism and facilitates the identification of
intrinsic and mechanical transition states.

We study the kinetics of folding of a heteropolymer containing a specific sequence of
hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and neutral residues. The heteropolymer, representing the alpha
carbon sequence of a model protein, folds into a tJ-barrel structure below a characteristic
folding transition temperature. Several measures are introduced to probe the dynamics of
approach to a folded state with particular emphasis on the kinetics of formation of nonbonded
contacts starting from a high temperature random configuration. The measures of compactness
are used to argue that even below the folding temperature, nonbonded contacts are formed at a
very slow rate. This result is further corroborated by analyzing the dynamics of relaxation of
the nonbonded interactions which are responsible for the formation of folded structures at low
temperatures. We also show that below the folding transition temperature and for short times,
the heteropolymer undergoes large structural fluctuations. Examination of the time
dependence of the radius of gyration R g shows that the heteropolymer is trapped in one
minimum (characterized by a roughly constant Rg) for arbitrary times followed by sudden
excursions to neighboring minima. In this regime, multistate kinetics is appropriate. However,
at longer times when the heteropolymer becomes trapped in one of the minima corresponding
to the folded conformation, the folding process appears to be an all or none process. The
implication of our results for the kinetics of in vitro folding of proteins are discussed.

Most materials attain a glassy state at low temperatures under suitable methods
of preparation. This state exhibits the mechanical properties of a solid, but
shows microscopic structural disorder1,2. A comprehensive understanding of the
glassy state is, however, still lacking3. A widespread assumption is that the
non-exponential relaxation processes observed in the dynamics of glasses — and
also in protein dynamics, protein folding and population dynamics — are (in
common with other manifestations of complex dynamics) strongly influenced by
the underlying energy landscape associated with the structural configurations
that the system may adopt. But concrete evidence for this in studies of glass
formation has been scarce. Here we present such evidence, obtained from
computer simulations of a model glass-forming liquid. We demonstrate that the
onset of non-exponential relaxation corresponds to a well defined temperature
below which the depth of the potential-energy minima explored by the liquid
increases with decreasing temperature, and above which it does not. At lower
temperatures, we observe a sharp transition when the liquid gets trapped in the
deepest accessible energy basin. This transition temperature depends on the
cooling rate, in a manner analogous to the experimental glass transition. We
also present evidence that the barrier heights separating potential-energy
minima sampled by the liquid increase abruptly at a temperature above the glass
transition but well below the onset of non-exponential relaxation. This
identification of a relationship between static, topographic features of the
energy landscape and complex dynamics holds the promise of a clearer, possibly
thermodynamic, understanding of the glass transition.

   hydrophobic core contacts involving the third P-strand, and presages
   the later transition state in which the correct strand alignment of

associated with a select number of polypeptides and proteins, such as the giant
muscle protein, titin, and the extracellular matrix protein, tenascin. Both
proteins have been the subject of atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser tweezer,
and other in vitro methods for examining the effects of force extension on the
globular (FNIII/Ig-like) domains that comprise each protein. In this report we
present a time-dependent method for simulating AFM force extension and its
effect on FNIII/Ig domain unfolding and refolding. This method treats the
unfolding and refolding process as a standard three-state protein folding model
(U right arrow over left arrow T right arrow over left arrow F, where U is the
unfolded state, T is the transition or intermediate state, and F is the fully
folded state), and integrates this approach within the wormlike chain (WLC)
concept. We simulated the effect of AFM tip extension on a hypothetical titin
molecule comprised of 30 globular domains (Ig or FNIII) and 25% Pro-Glu-Val-Lys
(PEVK) content, and analyzed the unfolding and refolding processes as a
function of AFM tip extension, extension rate, and variation in PEVK content.
In general, we find that the use of a three-state protein-folding kinetic-based
model and the implicit inclusion of PEVK domains can accurately reproduce the
experimental force-extension curves observed for both titin and tenascin
proteins. Furthermore, our simulation data indicate that PEVK domains exhibit
extensibility behavior, assist in the unfolding and refolding of FNIII/Ig
domains in the titin molecule, and act as a force "buffer" for the FNIII/Ig
domains, particularly at low and moderate extension forces.

bond along a dissociation pathway is fully explored through Brownian-thermal
excitations, and energy barriers become encoded in a dissociation rime that
varies with applied force. Probed with ramps of force over an enormous range of
rates (force/time), this kinetic profile is transformed into a dynamic spectrum
of bond rupture force as a function of loading rate. On a logarithmic scale in
loading rate, the force spectrum provides an easy-to-read map of the prominent
energy barriers traversed along the force-driven pathway and exposes the
differences in energy between barriers. In this way, the method of dynamic
force spectroscopy (DFS) is being used to probe the complex relation between
force-lifetime-and chemistry in single molecular bonds. Most important, DFS
probes the inner world of molecular interactions to reveal barriers that are
difficult or impossible to detect in assays of near equilibrium dissociation
but that determine bond lifetime and strength under rapid detachment. To use an
ultrasensitive force probe as a spectroscopic tool, we need to understand the
physics of bond dissociation under force, the impact of experimental technique
on the measurement of detachment force (bond strength), the consequences of
complex interactions in macromolecular bonds, and effects of multiply-bonded
attachments.}"

  abstract={
Bond dissociation under steadily rising force occurs most frequently at a time
governed by the rate of loading (Evans and Ritchie, 1997 Biophys. J.
72:1541–1555). Multiplied by the loading rate, the breakage time specifies the
force for most frequent failure (called bond strength) that obeys the same
dependence on loading rate. The spectrum of bond strength versus log(loading
rate) provides an image of the energy landscape traversed in the course of
unbonding. However, when a weak bond is connected to very compliant elements
like long polymers, the load applied to the bond does not rise steadily under
constant pulling speed. Because of nonsteady loading, the most frequent
breakage force can differ significantly from that of a bond loaded at constant
rate through stiff linkages. Using generic models for wormlike and freely
jointed chains, we have analyzed the kinetic process of failure for a bond
loaded by pulling the polymer linkages at constant speed. We find that when
linked by either type of polymer chain, a bond is likely to fail at lower force
under steady separation than through stiff linkages. Quite unexpectedly, a
discontinuous jump can occur in bond strength at slow separation speed in the
case of long polymer linkages. We demonstrate that the predictions of strength
versus log(loading rate) can rationalize conflicting results obtained recently
for unfolding Ig domains along muscle titin with different force techniques.  }

abstract={
Recently, it has become possible to unfold a single protein molecule titin, by
pulling it with an atomic-force-microscope tip. In this paper, we propose and
study a stochastic kinetic model of this unfolding process. Our model assumes
that each immunoglobulin domain of titin is held together by six hydrogen
bonds. The external force pulls on these bonds and lowers the energy barrier
that prevents the hydrogen bond from breaking; this increases the rate of bond
breaking and decreases the rate of bond healing. When all six bonds are broken,
the domain unfolds. Since the experiment controls the pulling rate, not the
force, the latter is calculated from a wormlike chain model for the protein. In
the limit of high pulling rate, this kinetic model is solved by a novel
simulation method. In the limit of low pulling rate, we develop a
quasiequilibrium rate theory, which is tested by simulations. The results are
in agreement with the experiments: the distribution of the unfolding force and
the dependence of the mean unfolding force on the pulling rate are similar to
those measured. The simulations also explain why the work of the force to break
bonds is less than the bond energy and why the breaking-force distribution
varies from sample to sample. We suggest that one can synthesize polymers that
are well described by our model and that they may have unusual mechanical
properties.

pulling experiments based on Bell's expression for the force-induced rupture
rate is found to be inadequate when tested against computer simulations of a
simple microscopic model of the dynamics. We introduce a new approach of
comparable complexity to extract more accurate kinetic information about the
molecular events from pulling experiments. Our procedure is based on the
analysis of a simple stochastic model of pulling with a harmonic spring and
encompasses the phenomenological approach, reducing to it in the appropriate
limit. Our approach is tested against computer simulations of a multimodule
titin model with anharmonic linkers and then an illustrative application is
made to the forced unfolding of I27 subunits of the protein titin. Our
procedure to extract kinetic information from pulling experiments is simple to
implement and should prove useful in the analysis of experiments on a variety

	Here, we show how by using temperature as a variable in mechanical

	reaction domains in cytochrome b and cytochrome c(1) subunits. In
	this paper we report the results of steered molecular dynamics simulations
	inducing, through an applied torque within 1 ns, a 56 degrees rotation
	of the soluble domain of ISP. For this purpose, a solvated structure
	of the bc(1) complex in a phospholipid bilayer (a total of 206,720
	atoms) was constructed. A subset of 91,061 atoms was actually simulated
	with 45,131 moving atoms. Point charge distributions for the force
	field parametrization of heme groups and the Fe(2)S(2) cluster of
	the Rieske protein included in the simulated complex were determined.
	The simulations showed that rotation of the soluble domain of ISP
	is actually feasible. Several metastable conformations of the ISP
	during its rotation were identified and the interactions stabilizing
	the initial, final, and intermediate positions of the soluble head
	of the ISP domain were characterized. A pathway for proton conduction
	from the Q(o) site to the solvent via a water channel has been identified.},

   the low-temperature dynamical behaviour is characterized by a sequence
   of local equilibrations in increasingly larger regions of phase space

Abstract = {{The computational task of protein structure prediction is believed to
   require exponential time, but previous arguments as to its
   intractability have taken into account only the size of a protein's
   conformational space. Such arguments do not rule out the possible
   existence of an algorithm, more selective than exhaustive search, that
   is efficient and exact. (An efficient algorithm is one that is
   guaranteed, for all possible inputs, to run in time bounded by a
   function polynomial in the problem size. An intractable problem is one
   for which no efficient algorithm exists.) Questions regarding the
   possible intractability of problems are often best answered using the
   theory of NP-completeness. In this treatment we show the NP-hardness of
   two typical mathematical statements of empirical potential energy
   function minimization of macromolecules. Unless all NP-complete
   problems can be solved efficiently, these results imply that a function
   minimization algorithm can be efficient for protein structure
   prediction only if it exploits protein-specific properties that
   prohibit the simple geometric constructions that we use in our proofs.
   Analysis of further mathematical statements of molecular structure
   prediction could constitute a systematic methodology for identifying

Abstract = {{The folding of several model proteins is studied using three
   optimization algorithms which are based on the simulated annealing of
   an approximation to the classical density distribution. These methods
   are derived from the approximate solution of equations of motion for
   the time or temperature evolution of the density distribution.
   Therefore, it is of interest to analyze not only the resulting lowest
   energy molecular conformations but also the folding mechanism followed
   during the annealing runs. The results are compared with classical
   simulated annealing based on molecular dynamics and the diffusion
   equation method of Scheraga and coworkers. The model proteins studied
   are 22-mers and a 46-mer based on a three-letter code used by Honeycutt
   and Thirumalai. The potential models the basic properties of attractive
   interactions between hydrophobic residues, to encourage the formation
   of a hydrophobic core, and the propensity of hydrophilic residues to be
   found at the protein surface. Analysis of the thermodynamically
   dominant structures during annealing reveals a collapse transition at
   high temperature followed by a strong folding transition to the native
   state at lower temperatures. This general mechanism has been seen
   previously in simulations of similar model proteins and predicted on
   the basis of mean field theories of heteropolymers. We find that the
   probability of success in finding the set of lowest energy native
   states is strongly correlated with the energy separation between the
   native (and native-like) and non-native states. Our optimization
   algorithms are effective in finding those low-energy structures which
   correspond to the global energy minimum fold. The results indicate that
   dynamical phase space simulated annealing methods may have an advantage
   over configuration space based search for complex fold topologies.}},

	we essentially allowed only one unfolded molecule to exist in solution
	at a given time, effectively eliminating the possibility for aggregation.
	We found that BCX can readily refold back to the native state, allowing
	us to measure its folding kinetics for the first time. Our results
	demonstrate that single-molecule force-spectroscopy-based methods
	can adequately tackle the challenge of "un-boiling eggs", providing

  abstract = {We use a three-dimensional lattice model of proteins to investigate
	systematically the global properties of the polypeptide chains that
	determine the folding to the native conformation starting from an
	ensemble of denatured conformations. In the coarse-grained description,
	the polypeptide chain is modeled as a heteropolymer consisting of
	N beads confined to the vertices of a simple cubic lattice. The interactions
	between the beads are taken from a random gaussian distribution of
	energies, with a mean value B0 < 0 that corresponds to the overall
	average hydrophobic interaction energy. We studied 56 sequences all
	with a unique ground state (native conformation) covering two values
	of N (15 and 27) and two values of B0. The smaller value of magnitude
	of B0 was chosen so that the average fraction of hydrophobic residues
	corresponds to that found in natural proteins. The higher value of
	magnitude of B0 was selected with the expectation that only the fully
	compact conformations would contribute to the thermodynamic behavior.
	For N = 15 the entire conformation space (compact as well as noncompact
	structures) can be exhaustively enumerated so that the thermodynamic
	properties can be exactly computed at all temperatures. The thermodynamic
	properties for the 27-mer chain were calculated using the slow cooling
	technique together with standard Monte Carlo simulations. The kinetics
	of approach to the native state for all the sequences was obtained
	using Monte Carlo simulations. For all sequences we find that there
	are two intrinsic characteristic temperatures, namely, T theta and
	Tf. At the temperature T theta the polypeptide chain makes a transition
	to a collapsed structure, while at Tf the chain undergoes a transition
	to the native conformation. We show that foldability of sequences
	can be characterized entirely in terms of these two temperatures.
	It is shown that fast folding sequences have small values of sigma
	= (T theta - Tf)/T theta whereas slow folders have larger values
	of sigma (the range of sigma is 0 < sigma < 1). The calculated values
	of the folding times correlate extremely well with sigma. An increase
	in sigma from 0.1 to 0.7 can result in an increase of 5-6 orders
	of magnitudes in folding times. In contrast, we demonstrate that
	there is no useful correlation between folding times and the energy
	gap between the native conformation and the first excited state at
	any N for any value of B0. In particular, in the parameter space
	of the model, many sequences with varying energy gaps, all with roughly
	the same folding time, can be easily engineered. Folding sequences
	in this model, therefore, can be classified based solely on the value
	of sigma. Fast folders have small values of sigma (typically less
	than about 0.1), moderate folders have values of sigma in the approximate
	range between 0.1 and 0.6, while for slow folders sigma exceeds 0.6.
	The precise boundary between these categories depends crucially on
	N and on the model. The range of sigma for fast folders decreases
	with the length of the chain. At temperatures close to Tf fast folders
	reach the native conformation via a native conformation nucleation
	collapse mechanism without forming any detectable intermediates,
	whereas only a fraction of molecule phi (T) reaches the native conformation
	by this process for moderate folders. The remaining fraction reaches
	the native state via three-stage multipathway process. For slow folders
	phi (T) is close to zero at all temperatures. The simultaneous requirement
	of native state stability and kinetic accessibility can be achieved
	at high enough temperatures for those sequences with small values
	of sigma. The utility of these results for de novo design of proteins
	is briefly discussed.},

infer the apparent diameter of two biologically relevant polyelectrolytes,
namely DNA and poly-U, for different ionic strengths. Due to the very different
degrees of flexibility of the two molecules, the results provide insight into
how the apparent diameter is influenced by the interplay between the
(solution-dependent) Debye screening length and the polymers' `bare' thickness.
For DNA, the electrostatic contribution to the effective radius, Delta, is
found to be about five times larger than the Debye screening length, consistent
with previous theoretical predictions for highly charged stiff rods. For the
more flexible poly-U chains the electrostatic contribution to Delta is found to
be significantly smaller than the Debye screening length.}"

occurs through intermediates. The stretching rates of individual molecules show
great variations reflecting the heterogeneity of force-induced unfolding
pathways. The approach to the stretched state occurs in a stepwise “quantized”
manner. Unfolding dynamics and forces required to stretch proteins depend
sensitively on topology. The unfolding rates increase exponentially with force
f till an optimum value, which is determined by the barrier to unfolding when f
= 0. A mapping of these results to proteins shows qualitative agreement with
force-induced unfolding of Ig-like domains in titin. We show that
single-molecule force spectroscopy can be used to map the folding free energy
landscape of proteins in the absence of denaturants.},

simple Gō-like protein model and analyze the folding rate constants,
characteristics of the transition state ensemble, and those of the denatured
states in terms of native topology and chain length. Near the folding
transition temperature, the folding rate kF scales as kF  exp(−c RCO N0.6)
where RCO and N are the relative contact order and number of residues,
respectively. Here the topology RCO dependence of the rates is close to that
found experimentally (kF  exp(−c RCO)), while the chain length N dependence is
in harmony with the predicted scaling property (kF  exp(−c N2/3)). Thus, this
may provides a unified scaling law in folding rates at the transition
temperature, kF  exp(−c RCO N2/3). The degree of residual structure in the
denatured state is highly correlated with RCO, namely, proteins with smaller
RCO tend to have more ordered structure in the denatured state. This is
consistent with the observation that many helical proteins such as myoglobin
and protein A, have partial helices, in the denatured states. The
characteristics of the transition state ensemble calculated by the current
model, which uses native topology but not sequence specific information, are
consistent with experimental φ-value data for about half of proteins.

	abstract ={With the use of dynamic Monte Carlo simulations, the necessary
conditions for the collapse from a random-coil denatured state to a
structurally unique four-member beta-barrel native state of a model globular
protein have been investigated. These systems are free to roam through all of
configuration space--both native and nonnative interactions are allowed. The
relative importance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions and the
presence or absence of statistical bend-forming regions for the formation of a
unique native state are examined, and the conditions necessary for a
denatured-to-native (and vice versa) conformational transition that is
thermodynamically all-or-none and which always results in collapse to the same,
four-member beta-barrel are explored. These conditions are found to be a
general pattern of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues that allows the native
state to differentiate the interior from the exterior of the protein and the
presence of regions that are, at the very least, neutral toward turn formation.
The former set of interactions seems to define the mean length of the
beta-stretch, and the latter set serves to lock the native state into the
lowest free energy state, the native conformation. These folding simulations
strongly suggest that the general rules of protein folding are rather robust
and that site-specific tertiary interactions are only involved in structural
fine tuning. The conditions required for the formation of a structurally unique
native state from a manifold of collapsed conformations that are originally
quite close in energy is highly suggestive of a mechanism of protein evolution
by means of random mutations. The implications of these folding studies for
such a mechanism are qualitatively explored.}, URL =

chain lengths from 50 to 800 segments. The model includes both repulsive
(excluded volume) and attractive segment–segment interactions. It is shown that
the polymers group into two classes, ‘‘flexible’’ and ‘‘stiff.’’ The flexible
polymers exhibit decreasing chain dimensions as the temperature decreases with
a gradual collapse from a loose random coil, high temperature state to a dense
random coil, low temperature state. The stiffer polymers, on the other hand,
exhibit increasing chain dimensions with decreasing temperature until at a
critical temperature there is a sudden collapse to an ordered high density, low
temperature state. This difference is due to the relative strength of the
segment–segment attractive interactions compared to the energetic preference
for a trans conformational state over a gauche state. When the attractive
interaction is relatively strong (flexible case) the polymer starts to collapse
before rotational degrees of freedom freeze out, leading to a disordered dense
state. When the attractive interaction is relatively weak (stiff case) the
polymer starts to freeze out rotational degrees of freedom before it finally
collapses to a highly ordered dense state.

kinetics and may also cause a switch of folding mechanism from that at zero
force. It is not clear from the kinetics alone whether the change is a
continuous distortion of the zero force pathway or it occurs via a ``discrete
switch{''} to an alternative pathway. We use molecular simulations to dissect
this switch of mechanism as a pulling force is applied to protein G via four
different pairs of residues, or ``pulling coordinates{''}. Using a statistical
clustering approach based on the pattern of native contact formation, we find
distinct unfolding mechanisms at low and high force. For pulling coordinates
for which the protein is resistant to the applied force, a marked
``turnover{''} in the force-dependent unfolding kinetics is associated with an
abrupt switch to a novel mechanical unfolding pathway. In contrast, pulling
along coordinates where the protein has low resistance to force induces a
smoother acceleration in the unfolding rate and a more gradual shift in the
unfolding mechanism. The switch in folding pathway is captured by projection
onto appropriate two-dimensional free energy surfaces, which separate the low
and high force transition states. Remarkably, we find for a weak coordinate
that the high force transition state is already accessible in the absence of
force. Brownian dynamics simulations on these surfaces capture the force
dependence of the kinetics, supporting the use of simplified low-dimensional
models for interpreting mechanical unfolding experiments. We discuss the
implications of the switch in pathway for the mechanical strength of proteins,
and how such a switch may be experimentally tested.}"

Dynamic coexistence of several phaselike forms, a solid, microcrystalline

that the low-dimensional FELs are not always sufficient for the description of
folding or unfolding processes. Similarities between the topographies of FELs

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{5437-5441}},

Abstract = {{We extend the application of the direct inversion in the iterative
   subspace (DIIS) technique to the ridge method for finding transition
   states (TS). The latter Is not a quasi-Newton-type algorithm, which is
   the only class of geometry optimization methods that has been combined
   with DIIS. With this new combination, we obtain a factor of two speedup
   due to DIIS, similar to the DIlS-related speedup achieved in other
   methods including quasi-Newton geometry optimization and
   self-consistent field iterations. We also demonstrate that DIIS is
   useful even in cases where optimization is started far from the
   quadratic region of the TS, provided that only one previous iteration
   is used in the DIIS expansion. We compare the performance of the new
   ridge-DLTS method to that of the TS algorithm utilized in GAUSSIAN 92.
   We find that the computational cost of the former is similar (when both
   methods converge) to that of the latter. The examples considered in the
   paper include a novel TS found for an isomerization of a cluster of six
   Na atoms. Locating such a TS poses a known problem for
   second-derivatives-based algorithms that fail on very flat potential
   energy surfaces. Thus, the gradient-based ridge-DIIS method is the only
   TS;search method that is robust, does not need second derivatives
   and/or an initial guess for the TS geometry, and whose performance
   matches or exceeds that of a second-derivatives-based algorithm. (C)

complex polymers, such as proteins, includes information about their structure
and their dynamics. In particular it is of utmost importance to answer the
following questions: What are the structural conformations possible? Is there
any relevant hierarchy among these conformers? What are the transition paths
between them? These and other questions can be addressed by analyzing in an
efficient way the Free Energy Landscape of the system. With this knowledge,
several problems about biomolecular reactions (such as enzymatic activity,
protein folding, protein deposition diseases, etc.) can be tackled. In this
article we show how to efficiently describe the Free Energy Landscape for small
and large peptides. By mapping the trajectories of molecular dynamics
simulations into a graph (the Conformational Markov Network) and unveiling its
structural organization, we obtain a coarse grained description of the protein
dynamics across the Free Energy Landscape in terms of the relevant kinetic
magnitudes of the system. Therefore, we show the way to bridge the gap between
the microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic kinetics by means of a mesoscopic
description of the associated Conformational Markov Network. Along this path
the compromise between the physical nature of the process and the magnitudes
that characterize the network is carefully kept to assure the reliability of
the results shown.</p> },

systems is proposed. It is tested on alanine dipeptide (AD) with four minima
and eight transition states and applied to a flexible molecule,
isobutyryl–(ala)3–NH–methyl (IAN), the shortest peptide which can form a full
helical turn. There were found 138 minima and 490 transition states for IAN. It
is shown that the connectivity network between the minima is very dilute and
composed of transitions localized on one or two neighboring amide units. Most
of the transitions involve one or two dihedral flips. The reaction coordinate
from an extended chain conformation to a helix follows a sequence of
nonoverlapping rotations around bonds. The rotations along the reaction
coordinates are such that the hard repulsions between different atoms are
minimized but at the same time the hydrogen bonding and the electrostatic
interactions are maximized. A melting‐like transition which is associated with
the sudden opening of a large number of hopping channels is identified between
minima at approximately 5 kcal/mol above the lowest energy minimum. The
calculated minima and transition states are used to construct a master equation
for the two molecules. The vibrational spectrum of the N–H stretch as a
function of time and temperature is finally calculated. It is demonstrated that
time‐dependent lineshape analysis can be a useful tool to investigate the
properties of the large number of minima and the intervening transitions.

potential energy surface are monitored as the volume is changed, including
normal mode frequencies, barrier heights, and orientations and distances

Molecular simulations show that shear strains arising from liquid flow cause
local minima of the potential-energy surface to disappear, leading to
mechanical instabilities which force the system towards alternate local minima.
Associated with these mechanical instabilities are irreversible atomic
displacements, which are strain activated rather than thermally activated.
These displacements generate self-diffusion in excess of that from
thermal-activation alone and give rise to the shear-enhanced self-diffusion
known to occur in flowing liquids and concentrated suspensions of particles.
The magnitude of this enhancement is shown to decrease with increasing
temperature and strain rate.  }

by simulated annealing. Employing a distance geometry approach, we efficiently
generate novel, low-energy conformations from each set of distance constraints,
including the apparent native structure, up to 40 times faster than by doing
additional simulated annealing runs. Over 33 000 unique locally optimized

sequence B9N3(LB)4N3B9N3(LB)4N3B9N3(LB)5L, where B, L, and N designate
hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and neutral residues, respectively. The 69-residue
BLN protein folds into a six-stranded β-barrel structure. The CSA method always
maintains the diversity of sampling and is able to cross the high energy
barriers between local minima. The CSA successfully located the global minimum
of the 69-residue BLN protein for all 100 independent runs. For a single run,
it takes about 3 h and 30 min on average to obtain the global minimum on a
Linux PC. Also, we investigate the properties of the 69-residue BLN protein,
and the general behavior of the M-residue BLN protein for CSA runs.

The distribution in the external flux at which a superconducting ring closed with a weak link admits a quantum of flux is determined assuming that the weak link can be treated as a Josephson junction. We find that this transition occurs at an appreciable fraction of the flux quantum from the theoretical critical external flux. To a first approximation the width of the distribution is proportional to the inductance of the ring and varies as T2/3ic-1/3, where T is the temperature and ic the critical current.

Recent advances in single molecule experiments have raised many challenges.
These challenges can be met by a proper understanding of the inter- and
intra-molecular interactions in the framework of physics followed by suitable
theoretical models substantiated by extensive numerical simulations. In this
review, we briefly discuss experimental, theoretical and numerical techniques
used to examine the dynamics of biomolecules under the application of external
mechanical force. We focus on issues which require special attention: the
relationship between the mechanical stability of a protein and the secondary
structure of its native conformation, the dependence of the free energy
landscape on the pulling direction and secondary structure content, unfolding
of a protein through a pore, protein re-folding under quenched force etc. We
pay special attention to a single stranded DNA, where the force-extension curve
shows a multi-step plateau for the chain made up of adenine while poly-thymine
exhibits entropic response only. There are many interesting predictions related
to unzipping of double stranded DNA e.g. re-entrance in the force-temperature
phase diagram, existence of an "Eye-phase", effects of random disorder etc.
based on model studies which require further investigation. We will also
discuss cases where the theoretical descriptions of the models fail to explain
the experimentally observed behavior and when further refinement is needed in
order to describe the outcomes of experiments. Finally we suggest certain
experimental protocols to observe theoretical predictions in vitro." }

      in order to evaluate the free energy landscapes of simple systems. These
      systems are manipulated by varying the external field coupled with a
      systems' internal characteristic variable. Two different manipulation
      protocols are considered here: in the first case the external field is a
      linear function of time; in the second case it is a periodic function of
      time. While for simple mean field systems both the linear protocol and
      the oscillatory protocol provide reliable estimates of the free energy
      landscape, for a simple model of a homopolymer the oscillatory protocol
      turns out to be not reliable for this purpose. We then discuss the

a diffusive drift away from the native state, while at weak forces thermal
activation is the relevant mechanism. An escape-time analysis within this

escape-time distribution upon passing from weak to strong forces. Moreover, a
single expression valid at weak and strong forces can be devised both for the
average unfolding time as well as for the corresponding variance. The analysis

abstract ={Single-molecule manipulation techniques reveal that stretching
unravels individually folded domains in the muscle protein titin and the
extracellular matrix protein tenascin. These elastic proteins contain tandem
repeats of folded domains with β-sandwich architecture. Herein, we propose by
stretching two model sequences (S1 and S2) with four-stranded β-barrel topology
that unfolding forces and pathways in folded domains can be predicted by using
only the structure of the native state. Thermal refolding of S1 and S2 in the
absence of force proceeds in an all-or-none fashion. In contrast, phase
diagrams in the force-temperature (f,T) plane and steered Langevin dynamics
studies of these sequences, which differ in the native registry of the strands,
show that S1 unfolds in an allor-none fashion, whereas unfolding of S2 occurs
via an obligatory intermediate. Force-induced unfolding is determined by the
native topology. After proving that the simulation results for S1 and S2 can be
calculated by using native topology alone, we predict the order of unfolding
events in Ig domain (Ig27) and two fibronectin III type domains (9FnIII and
10FnIII). The calculated unfolding pathways for these proteins, the location of
the transition states, and the pulling speed dependence of the unfolding forces
reflect the differences in the way the strands are arranged in the native
states. We also predict the mechanisms of force-induced unfolding of the
coiled-coil spectrin (a three-helix bundle protein) for all 20 structures
deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Our approach suggests a natural way to
measure the phase diagram in the (f,C) plane, where C is the concentration of

abstract={
RNA folding is a kinetic process governed by the competition of a large number
of structures stabilized by the transient formation of base pairs that may
induce complex folding pathways and the formation of misfolded structures.
Despite its importance in modern biophysics, the current understanding of RNA
folding kinetics is limited by the complex interplay between the weak base pair
interactions that stabilize the native structure and the disordering effect of
thermal forces. The possibility of mechanically pulling individual molecules
offers a new perspective to understand the folding of nucleic acids. Here we
investigate the folding and misfolding mechanism in RNA secondary structures
pulled by mechanical forces. We introduce a model based on the identification
of the minimal set of structures that reproduce the patterns of force-extension
curves obtained in single molecule experiments. The model requires only two
fitting parameters: the attempt frequency at the level of individual base pairs
and a parameter associated to a free-energy correction that accounts for the
configurational entropy of an exponentially large number of neglected secondary
structures. We apply the model to interpret results recently obtained in
pulling experiments in the three-helix junction S15 RNA molecule (RNAS15). We
show that RNAS15 undergoes force-induced misfolding where force favors the
formation of a stable non-native hairpin. The model reproduces the pattern of
unfolding and refolding force-extension curves, the distribution of breakage
forces, and the misfolding probability obtained in the experiments.  }

causes consecutive unfolding of each domain in an all-or-none fashion. To avoid
problems associated with the heterogeneity of the modular, naturally occurring
titin, we engineered single proteins to have multiple copies of single
immunoglobulin domains of human cardiac titin. Here we report the elongation of
these molecules using the atomic force microscope. We find an abrupt extension
of each domain by approximately 7 A before the first unfolding event. This fast
initial extension before a full unfolding event produces a reversible
'unfolding intermediate' Steered molecular dynamics simulations show that the
rupture of a pair of hydrogen bonds near the amino terminus of the protein
domain causes an extension of about 6 A, which is in good agreement with our
observations. Disruption of these hydrogen bonds by site-directed mutagenesis
eliminates the unfolding intermediate. The unfolding intermediate extends titin
domains by approximately 15% of their slack length, and is therefore likely to
be an important previously unrecognized component of titin elasticity.

abstract={ A geometric analysis of the global properties of the energy
landscape of a minimalistic model of a polypeptide is presented, which is based
on the relation between dynamical trajectories and geodesics of a suitable
manifold, whose metric is completely determined by the potential energy. We
consider different sequences, some with a definite proteinlike behavior, a
unique native state and a folding transition, and others undergoing a
hydrophobic collapse with no tendency to a unique native state. The global
geometry of the energy landscape appears to contain relevant information on the
behavior of the various sequences: in particular, the fluctuations of the
curvature of the energy landscape, measured by means of numerical simulations,
clearly mark the folding transition and allow the proteinlike sequences to be
distinguished from the others.

abstract={ In the last fifty years the seminal work by Kramers of 1940 has been
greatly extended both by elaboration on new theoretical approaches and through
applications to new experimental systems. The most interesting case turns out
to be the regime of weak-to-medium damping, in which case the Fokker-Planck
equation can be reduced to an equation or to a system of integral equations of
the Wiener-Hopf type. Exact solutions can then be given for the escape rate
from single- and double-well potentials. This general scheme can be naturally
extended to include quantum penetration through a semiclassical barrier and the
effect of quantum noise. Finally, we consider the Brownian motion in titled
washboard potential using Josephson junctions as an illustrative example. In
that context we calculate (i) fluctuation-induced voltage-current
characteristics; (ii) the lifetime of a zero-voltage state; (iii) the lifetime
of the running state; (iv) partial probabilities of the phase jumps by 2πn (n
is an integer); and (v) retrapping current distribution in both the classical
and quantum regimes.

	But for weak noncovalent bonds, a dynamic spectrum of bond strengths

	being governed by the prominent barriers traversed in the energy
	landscape along the force-driven bond-dissociation pathway. In other
	words, the pioneering early AFM measurements represent only a single
	point in a continuous spectrum of bond strengths, because theory
	predicts that these will depend on the rate at which the load is
	applied. Here we report the strength spectra for the bonds between
	streptavidin (or avidin) and biotins-the prototype of receptor-ligand
	interactions used in earlier AFM studies, and which have been modelled
	by molecular dynamics. We have probed bond formation over six orders
	of magnitude in loading rate, and find that the bond survival time
	diminished from about 1 min to 0.001 s with increasing loading rate
	over this range. The bond strength, meanwhile, increased from about
	5 pN to 170 pN. Thus, although they are among the strongest noncovalent
	linkages in biology (affinity of 10(13) to 10(15) M(-1)), these bonds
	in fact appear strong or weak depending on how fast they are loaded.
	We are also able to relate the activation barriers derived from our
	strength spectra to the shape of the energy landscape derived from
	simulations of the biotin-avidin complex.},

the thermodynamic transitions. The global minimum then has a significant
probability of occupation at temperatures where the free energy barriers
between funnels are surmountable.

We present a rigorous analysis of the role and uses of the adiabatic invariant

dynamics which in some respects has an improved behavior over the commonly used
one. We illustrate its behavior in a number of numerical results. We also
present a new formulation of the dynamics via catastrophe theory. We find that
the change from one era to the next corresponds to a fold catastrophe, during
the Kasner shifts the potential is an implicit function form whereas, as the
anisotropy dissipates, the mixmaster potential must become a Morse 0-saddle. We
compare and contrast our results to many known works on the mixmaster problem
and indicate how extensions could be achieved. Further exploitation of this
formulation may lead to a clearer understanding of the global mixmaster
dynamics.}

abstract={
New geometry optimization techniques are introduced for characterizing local
minima, transition states, and pathways corresponding to enthalpy surfaces at
constant pressure. Results are obtained for comparison with the potential
energy surfaces of model glass formers studied in previous work. The constant
pressure condition, where the the box lengths of the simulation cell vary,
makes the enthalpy surface less rugged than the potential energy surface
corresponding to the same mean density. Analysis of barrier heights as a
function of pressure provides insight into transport and relaxation processes.
Elementary rearrangements can be separated into "diffusive" and "nondiffusive"
processes, where the former involve changes in the nearest-neighbor
coordination of at least one atom, and the latter do not. With increasing
pressure the barrier heights for cage-breaking rearrangements rise, while those
for cage-preserving rearrangements appear relatively unchanged. The “strong” or
“fragile” character of the system can therefore change with pressure because
the barriers encountered vary in a systematic fashion. The geometric mean
normal mode frequencies of a binary Lennard-Jones system decrease with
increasing potential energy for constant pressure, rather than increase as they
do at constant volume, in agreement with a simple model.  }

abstract={ 
We investigate the thermodynamics and kinetics of DNA hairpins that
fold/unfold under the action of applied mechanical force. We introduce the
concept of the molecular free energy landscape and derive simplified
expressions for the force dependent Kramers–Bell rates. To test the theory we
have designed a specific DNA hairpin sequence that shows two-state cooperative
folding under mechanical tension and carried out pulling experiments using
optical tweezers. We show how we can determine the parameters that characterize
the molecular free energy landscape of such sequences from rupture force
kinetic studies. Finally we combine such kinetic studies with experimental
investigations of the Crooks fluctuation relation to derive the free energy of
formation of the hairpin at zero force.

Previous work has indicated that in calculating rates using activated-complex
theory one should omit symmetry numbers from the rotational partition functions
and multiply by a statistical factor; this factor is the number of equivalent
forms of the activated complex that can arise from the reactants. This
procedure can lead to error if the activated complex is chosen to have such a
high degree of symmetry that it can form more than one form of the reactants or
products. It is shown from a consideration of multi-dimensional
potential-energy surfaces that a single activated complex cannot exist at the
intersection of two valleys; three valleys, for example, will give rise to
three separate activated states, each of which represents the lowest pass
between a pair of valleys. The implications of this conclusion are considered
with reference to several reactions, including that between hydrogen and iodine

	one is often more interested in the potential of mean force of the
	unperturbed Hamiltonian, i.e., in the effective potential dictating
	the equilibrium distribution of the collective coordinate in the

	proposed an algorithm to estimate the desired free energy differences
	when pulling experiments are performed in only one direction of the
	process ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 3658 ). In this paper,
	we present a potential of mean force estimator of the unperturbed

	directions of the process. The method is based on the reweighting
	technique of Hummer and Szabo and on the Bennett acceptance ratio.
	Using Brownian-dynamics simulations on a double-well free energy
	surface, we show that the estimator works satisfactorily in any pulling
	situation, from nearly equilibrium to strongly dissipative regimes.
	The method is also applied to the unfolding/refolding process of
	decaalanine, a system vastly used to illustrate and to test nonequilibrium

now becoming possible with the help of the energy landscape theory and the
protein folding funnel concept. Good folding sequences have a landscape that
resembles a rough funnel where the energy bias towards the native state is
larger than its ruggedness. Such a landscape leads not only to fast folding and
stable native conformations but, more importantly, to sequences that are robust
to variations in the protein environment and to sequence mutations. In this
paper, an off-lattice model of sequences that fold into a β-barrel native
structure is used to describe a framework that can quantitatively distinguish
good and bad folders. The two sequences analyzed have the same native
structure, but one of them is minimally frustrated whereas the other one
exhibits a high degree of frustration.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Energy landscape theory predicts that the folding funnel
	for a small fast-folding alpha-helical protein will have a transition
	state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the position of
	the transition state along an appropriate reaction coordinate can
	be obtained from linear free energy relationships observed for folding
	and unfolding rate constants as a function of denaturant concentration.
	The experimental results of Huang and Oas for lambda repressor, Fersht
	and collaborators for C12, and Gray and collaborators for cytochrome
	c indicate a free energy barrier midway between the folded and unfolded
	regions. This barrier arises from an entropic bottleneck for the
	folding process. RESULTS: In keeping with the experimental results,
	lattice simulations based on the folding funnel description show
	that the transition state is not just a single conformation, but
	rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of configurations
	that can be described by specific values of one or a few order parameters
	(e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of this transition
	state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations and from
	atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko and Brooks
	indicates a broad distribution for native contact participation in
	the transition state ensemble centered around 50\%. Importantly,
	however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble does include
	some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the experiments, which
	have been termed by others a folding nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Linear
	free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy of the transition
	state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction coordinate based
	on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck may be thought
	of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different native contacts
	will have different degrees of participation. The agreement between
	the experimental results and the theoretical predictions provides
	strong support for the landscape analysis.},

Our expressions address the problems of singularities that are intrinsic in
popular angle energy functions and that occur from other chain rule derivations
of force expressions. Most chain rule derivations of expressions for Cartesian
forces due to angle energies make use of relations such as {[}GRAPHICS] where
phi is a bond or torsion angle, E(phi) is energy, and partial
derivative/partial derivative represents a derivative with respect to some
Cartesian coordinate. This expression leads to singularities from the middle
term, -1/sin-phi, when phi is 0 or pi. This is a problem that prevents the use
of torsional energy expressions that have phase angles, e, other than 0 or pi,
such as in E(phi) = kappa{[}1 + cos(n-phi - phi-degrees)]. Our derivations make
use of a different, but equivalent, form of the chain rule: {[}GRAPHICS] This
form still possesses singularities for the bond angle forces since the last
factor is undefined when phi is 0 or pi. However, the alternate form may be
used to great advantage for the torsional angle forces where no such problem
arises. The new expressions are necessary if one desires the use of torsional
energy expressions with general phase angles. Even for energy expressions in
common use, i.e., with phase angles of 0 or pi, our force expressions are as
computationally efficient as the standard ones. The new expressions are
applicable to all molecular simulations that employ restrained, or
phase-shifted, torsional angle energy expressions.}"

abstract ={The mechanism of formation of β-sheets is of great importance
because of the significant role of such structures in the initiation and
propagation of amyloid diseases. In this study we examine the folding of a
series of three-stranded antiparallel β-sheets known as WW domains. Whereas
other WW domains have been shown to fold with single-exponential kinetics, the
WW domain from murine formin-binding protein 28 has recently been shown to fold
with biphasic kinetics. By using a combination of kinetics and thermodynamics
to characterize a simple model for this protein, the origins of the biphasic
kinetics is found to lie in the fact that most of the protein is able to fold
without requiring one of the β-hairpins to be correctly registered. The correct
register of this hairpin is enforced by a surface-exposed hydrophobic contact,

force spectroscopy experiments. The standard theory predicts that the typical
unbinding force f{*} is linearly proportional to the logarithm of the loading
rate r when a single energy barrier controls the unbinding process. For a more
complex situation of N barriers, it predicts at most N linear segments for the
f{*} vs. log(r) curve, each segment characterizing a different barrier. Here we
extend this existing picture using a refined approximation, provide a more
general analytical formula, and show that in principle up to N(N + 1) / 2
segments can show up experimentally. As a consequence, the determination of the
positions and even the number of the energy barriers from the experimental data
can be ambiguous. A further possible consequence of a multiple-barrier
landscape is a bimodal or multimodal distribution of the unbinding force at
certain loading rates, a feature recently observed experimentally.}"

unfolding proceeds by means of two subsequent intermediate states. The
transition from the native state to the first intermediate state occurs near
thermal equilibrium at approximate to35 pN and is characterized by detachment
of a seven-residue N-terminal alpha-helix from the beta barrel. We measure the
equilibrium free energy cost associated with this transition as 22 k(B)T.
Detachment of this small a-helix completely destabilizes GFP thermodynamically
even though the beta-barrel is still intact and can bear load. Mechanical
stability of the protein on the millisecond timescale, however, is determined
by the activation barrier of unfolding the beta-barrel out of this
thermodynamically unstable intermediate state. High bandwidth, time-resolved
measurements of the cantilever relaxation phase upon unfolding of the
beta-barrel revealed a second metastable mechanical intermediate with one
complete beta-strand detached from the barrel. Quantitative analysis of force
distributions and lifetimes lead to a detailed picture of the complex
mechanical unfolding pathway through a rough energy landscape.}"

severely destabilize 127 (DeltaDeltaG(UN) = 8.7 and 17.9 kJ mol(-1) for C63S

mechanical resistance for 127. Measuring the speed dependence of the force
required to unfold (127)(5){*} in triplicate using the atomic force microscope
allowed a reliable assessment of the intrinsic unfolding rate constant of the

measured by chemical denaturation is over fivefold faster (1.1 x 10(-2) s(-1)),
suggesting that these techniques probe different unfolding pathways. Also, by
comparing the parameters obtained from the mechanical unfolding of a wild-type

abstract={
Global measures of structural diversity within a distribution of biopolymers,
such as the radius of gyration and percent native contacts, have proven useful
in the analysis of simulation data for protein folding. In this paper we
describe a statistical-based methodology to quantify the local structural
variability of a distribution of biopolymers, applied to 46- and 69-“residue”
off-lattice, three-color model proteins. Each folds into β-barrel structures.
First we perform a principal component analysis of all interbead distance
variables for a large number of independent, converged Boltzmann-distributed
samples of conformations collected at each of a wide range of temperatures.
Next, the principal component vectors are subjected to orthogonal (varimax)
rotation. The results are displayed on so-called “squared-loading” plots. These
provide a quantitative measure of the contribution to the sample variance of
the position of each residue relative to the others. Dominant structural
elements, those having the largest structural diversity within the sampled
distribution, are responsible for peaks and shoulders observed in the specific
heat versus temperature curves, generated using the weighted histogram analysis
method. The loading plots indicate that the local-structural diversity of these
systems changes gradually with temperature through the folding transition but
radically changes near the collapse transition temperature. The analysis of the
structural overlap order statistic suggests that the 46-mer thermodynamic
folding transition involves the native state and at least three other nearly
native intermediates. In the case of the 46-mer protein model, data are
generated at sufficiently low temperatures that squared-loading plots, coupled
with cluster analysis, provide a local and energetic description of its glassy
state.}

An algorithm for locating transition states on a potential energy surface is described. The most important
feature of the algorithm, which makes explicit use of the second derivative matrix of the potential surface, is
that it is able to "walk uphill" from the minimum on a potential surface to the transition state essentially
automatically. The method is illustrated by application to a two dimensional model problem, to the
vinylidene-acetylene rearrangement (H,C = C:_HC=:CH), and to the dissociation and rearrangement of
formaldehyde (H,CO_H, + CO, HCOH). The algorithm is also seen to provide an improved way of
following a reaction path from a transition state down to reactants or products.

pulling proteins in different directions relative to their secondary structure,
one can gain a better understanding of the shape of the energy landscape. We
consider simple lattice models which are anisotropic in nature to study the
response of a force in unfolding of a polymer. Our analytical solution of the
model, supported by extensive numerical calculations, reveal that the force
temperature diagrams are very different depending on the direction of the
applied force. We find that either unzipping or shearing kind transitions
dominate the dynamics of the unfolding process depending solely on the
direction of the applied force.

temperature range from 5 degrees C to 37 degrees C. Analyzing the distributions
of unfolding forces allowed us to extract transition barrier heights and
positions of the underlying energy landscape. We found a marked narrowing of
unfolding force distributions with increasing temperature. This narrowing
reflects an increase in transition state position from 2.7 angstrom to 7.8
angstrom and thus a reduction of the molecular spring constant of the protein
by a factor of 7. We suggest this temperature softening reflects a shift in the
nature of the interactions responsible for mechanical stability from hydrogen
bonds to hydrophobic interactions. This result has important consequences for
all interpretations of protein mechanical studies if experimental results
obtained at room temperature are to be transferred to physiological
temperatures. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}",

the first to compare the Golding of structurally related proteins that are

I review single-molecule experiments (SMEs) in biological physics. Recent
technological developments have provided the tools to design and build
scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate

it is possible to manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions
describing molecular properties, characterize the kinetics of biomolecular
reactions and detect molecular intermediates. SMEs provide additional
information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This
complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SMEs it is also
possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in
biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize
the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a
very introductory level, emphasizing the importance of SMEs to scientists
interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary
topics accessible by these techniques.

The review discusses SMEs from an experimental perspective, first exposing the
most common experimental methodologies and later presenting various molecular
systems where such techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental
techniques such as atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers
(LOTs), magnetic tweezers (MTs), biomembrane force probes (BFPs) and
single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I then present several applications of SME
to the study of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA and DNA condensation) and proteins
(protein–protein interactions, protein folding and molecular motors). Finally,
I discuss applications of SMEs to the study of the nonequilibrium

means of investigating protein folding kinetics. The energies of the
conformational states of the protein are taken to be random variables. The
degree of similarity of each state with the native is described by an order
parameter ρ. The energy is, on average, a decreasing function of ρ, in line
with the principle of minimal frustration. The limiting case model described
here has global connectivity. There are no restrictions on the change in order
parameter in the elementary moves through conformational space. The folding
kinetics vary as a function of both the energy gap between the folded and
unfolded states and the roughness of the energy landscape. This model yields
curved Arrhenius plots that are qualitatively similar to those seen in
experiments and in simulations of protein folding. We show that in globally
connected models, the Laplace transformed concentrations of species obey a
frequency dependent generalization of the law of mass action. We show that when
states with intermediate degrees of ordering are included in a globally
connected model, one obtains much the same qualitative behavior as some
experiments that are often used to justify the existence of specific
intermediates along a sequential pathway even though there is no such path in
the model. Also we show that for short times, populations of ensembles of
configurations are dominated by entropic considerations: an observation in
harmony with studies on initial events in folding based on more detailed
models. Thus, we believe that this model sheds light on the interpretation of
experiments that probe protein folding kinetics

abstract={ Two-state models provide phenomenological descriptions of many
different systems, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. We
investigate work fluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of
equilibrium under the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the
probability density PN(W) that work equal to W is exerted upon the system (of
size N) along a given non-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory
thermodynamics formalism to quantify work fluctuations in the large-N limit. We
then define a trajectory entropy SN(W) that counts the number of
non-equilibrium trajectories PN(W) = exp(SN(W)/kBT) with work equal to W and
characterizes fluctuations of work trajectories around the most probable value
Wmp. A trajectory free energy  can also be defined, which has a minimum at W =
W†, this being the value of the work that has to be efficiently sampled to
quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this formalism a Lagrange
multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays the role of a
trajectory temperature. Our general solution for PN(W) exactly satisfies the
fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate heat fluctuations
for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The heat distribution is
then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing small and frequent heat
exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the statistics of large
deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of the exponential tails
is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature. Finite-size effects to
the large-N theory and the recovery of work distributions for finite N are also
discussed. Finally, we pay particular attention to the case of magnetic
nanoparticle systems under the action of a magnetic field H where work and heat
fluctuations are predicted to be observable in ramping experiments in
micro-SQUIDs.

abstract = "Background Recent experimental and theoretical studies have
revealed that protein folding kinetics can be quite complex and diverse
depending on various factors such as size of the protein sequence and external
conditions. For example, some proteins fold apparently in a kinetically
two-state manner, whereas others follow complex routes to the native state. We
have set out to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse
behavior seen in the refolding kinetics of proteins in terms of properties that
are intrinsic to the sequence.Results: The folding kinetics of a number of
sequences for off-lattice continuum models of proteins is studied using
Langevin simulations at two different values of the friction coefficient. We
show for these models that there is a remarkable correlation between folding
time, [tau]F, and [sigma]=(T[theta] - TF)/T[theta], where T[theta] and TF are
the equilibrium collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. The
microscopic dynamics reveals that several scenarios for the kinetics of
refolding arise depending on the range of values of [sigma]. For relatively
small [sigma], the chain reaches the native conformation by a direct native
conformation nucleation collapse (NCNC) mechanism without being trapped in any
detectable intermediates. For moderate and large values of [sigma], the
kinetics is described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, according to which
a fraction of molecules [Phi] (kinetic partition factor) reach the native
conformation via the NCNC mechanism. The remaining fraction attains the native
state by off-pathway processes that involve trapping in several misfolded
structures. The rate-determining step in the off-pathway processes is the
transition from the misfolded structures to the native state. The partition
factor [Phi] is also determined by [sigma]: the smaller the value of [sigma],
the larger is [Phi]. The qualitative aspects of our results are found to be
independent of the friction coefficient. The simulation results and theoretical
arguments are used to obtain estimates for timescales for folding via the NCNC
mechanism in small proteins, those with less than about 70 amino acid
residues.Conclusions We have shown that the various scenarios for folding of
proteins, and possibly other biomolecules, can be classified solely in terms of
[sigma]. Proteins with small values of [sigma] reach the native conformation
via a nucleation collapse mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized
by having one dominant native basin of attraction (NBA). On the other hand,
proteins with large [sigma] get trapped in competing basins of attraction
(CBAs) in which they adopt misfolded structures. Only a small fraction of
molecules access the native state rapidly when [sigma] is large. For these
sequences, the majority of the molecules approach the native state by a
three-stage multipathway mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves
a transition from one of the CBAs to the NBA." }

extracting displacements from neutron elastic scattering data and the question
of the appropriate dynamic model, discrete transitions between states of
different energy versus continuous diffusion inside a harmonic well, are
discussed. A decomposition of the transition involving two motional components
is performed: rotational transitions of methyl groups and small scale
librations of side-chains, induced by water at the protein surface. Both
processes create an enhancement of the observed amplitude. The onset occurs,
when their time scale becomes compatible with the resolution of the
spectrometer. The reorientational rate of hydration water follows a
super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, a characteristic feature of a dynamical
transition. It occurs only with hydrated proteins, while the torsional motion
of methyl groups takes place also in the dehydrated or solvent-vitrified
system. Finally, the role of fast hydrogen bond fluctuations contributing to
the amplitude enhancement is discussed.  }

its metastable structures. First, we show how the inherent structure energy
density can be obtained from the probability density determined by sampling
molecular dynamics trajectories and quenching. The analysis of the inherent
structure landscape can characterize the folding transition. Then we show how
thermodynamics of the inherent states can be established to study the
equilibrium properties of proteins. Our work brings some elements into the
current discussion about the protein dynamical transition. The study uses a
simplified model to illustrate the ideas, but, as the inherent structure
landscape is much simpler than the free energy surface of the protein, it
appears to be accessible for an all-atom model of a small protein, at the
expense of much longer calculations.},

abstract={ The dynamical properties of two measures to probe ergodic behavior
in Hamiltonian systems with a large number of degrees of freedom are
investigated. The measures, namely, the energy metric d(t) and the fluctuation
metric Ω(t) are both based on the time-averaged energies of the individual
particles comprising the system. The energy metric d(t) is obtained by
following the dynamics of the system using two independent configurations,
whereas Ω(t) is expressed in terms of the properties of a single trajectory.
Both measures obey a dynamical scaling law for long but finite times. The
scaling law for d(t), which was previously established numerically, and for
Ω(t) is derived for systems that are effectively ergodic. The scaling function
suggests that the configuration space is explored by a ‘‘diffusive’’ process in
the space of the variables used to construct d(t) and Ω(t). Furthermore, a
single parameter, namely DE and DΩ, characterizes the time scales needed for
effective ergodicity to be obtained. These ideas are used to study the behavior
of supercooled and glassy states of soft-sphere binary alloys using
microcanonical molecular dynamics. The scaling forms for d(t) and Ω(t) are
explicitly demonstrated. The temperature dependence of the numerically computed
diffusion constants (DE and DΩ) reveals that the nature of phase-space
exploration changes both near the fluid-solid transition and near the
liquid-to-glass transition. The changes in DE and DΩ with temperature are well
described by a Vogel-Fulcher equation close to the glass transition
temperature. In addition, the distribution of the time-averaged individual
particle energies P(e;t), moments of which are related to Ω(t), is shown to be
broad in the glassy state. We argue that the time dependence of P(e;t) can be
used to probe local structural relaxations in glasses.

that the barrier crossing is a diffusive process. Nevertheless, the kinetic

larger than predicted by classical nucleation theory. The height of the barrier
is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. Although the
Lennard-Jones system has a stable face-centered cubic (fee) phase below the
melting line, the precritical nuclei are found to be mainly body-centered cubic

the interface the density falls off faster than the structural order parameter,
which is in agreement with the predictions of density functional calculations.

abstract={ The factors responsible for fast folding and stable 2D lattice
proteins are studied by Monte Carlo kinetic simulations and by full
enumeration. For weak effective coupling between residues ( i.e., high
temperatures) the folding time is mainly controlled by the free energy
gradient. When this coupling is strong, entrapment in local minima plays a
major role. The energy gap separating the native state from the remaining
conformations shows some correlation to the folding and unfolding times for a
variety of sequences. These concepts are related to the ratio Tf/Tg proposed by
Bryngelson and Wolynes. One source of local minima are strong, non‐native
(hindering) contacts. An exclusive increase in hindering contacts shows a
strong correlation between the energy gap and the folding/unfolding times.
Other local minima results from several native contacts that, if formed
prematurely, interfere with the formation of others. To study these factors, we
use a semispecific model characterized by attractive interactions between
similar residues. A procedure to design stabler sequences with smoother
landscapes is discussed. By comparing this model to the hydrophobic HP model,
we show how higher potential heterogeneity can be used to improve folding.

chain. The main conclusions derived from this model are the following: (a)
There are two characteristic times for the chain motion: One of them (Td) is
the equilibration time for the defect concentration, and is proportional to M2.
The other time (Tr) is the time required for complete renewal of the chain
conformation, and is proportional to M3.  (b) The over‐all mobility and
diffusion coefficients of the chain P are proportional to M−2.  (c) At times
t < Tr the mean square displacement of one monomer of P increases only like
〈(rt − r0)2〉  =  constt1/4.  These results may also turn out to be useful for
the (more difficult) problem of entanglement effects in unlinked molten

abstract ={Atomic force microscope manipulations of single polysaccharide
molecules have recently expanded conformational chemistry to include
force-driven transitions between the chair and boat conformers of the pyranose
ring structure. We now expand these observations to include chair inversion, a
common phenomenon in the conformational chemistry of six-membered ring
molecules. We demonstrate that by stretching single pectin molecules (1 →
4-linked α-d-galactouronic acid polymer), we could change the pyranose ring
conformation from a chair to a boat and then to an inverted chair in a clearly
resolved two-step conversion: 4C1 ⇄ boat ⇄ 1C4. The two-step extension of the
distance between the glycosidic oxygen atoms O1 and O4 determined by atomic
force microscope manipulations is corroborated by ab initio calculations of the
increase in length of the residue vector O1O4 on chair inversion. We postulate
that this conformational change results from the torque generated by the
glycosidic bonds when a force is applied to the pectin molecule. Hence, the
glycosidic bonds act as mechanical levers, driving the conformational
transitions of the pyranose ring. When the glycosidic bonds are equatorial (e),
the torque is zero, causing no conformational change. However, when the
glycosidic bond is axial (a), torque is generated, causing a rotation around
C—C bonds and a conformational change. This hypothesis readily predicts the
number of transitions observed in pyranose monomers with 1a-4a linkages (two),
1a-4e (one), and 1e-4e (none). Our results demonstrate single-molecule
mechanochemistry with the capability of resolving complex conformational
transitions.},

Carlo dynamics, we study the collapse and folding of proteinlike
heteropolymers. The polymers are 27 monomers long and consist of two monomer
types. Although these chains are too long for exhaustive enumeration of all
conformations, it is possible to enumerate all the maximally compact
conformations, which are 3 ×3×3 cubes. This allows us to select sequences that
have a unique global minimum. We then explore the kinetics of collapse and
folding and examine what features determine the various rates. The folding time
has a plateau over a broad range of temperatures and diverges at both high and
low temperatures. The folding time depends on sequence and is related to the
amount of energetic frustration in the native state. The collapse times of the
chains are sequence independent and are a few orders of magnitude faster than
the folding times, indicating a two‐phase folding process. Below a certain
temperature the chains exhibit glasslike behavior, characterized by a slowing
down of time scales and loss of self‐averaging behavior. We explicitly define
the glass transition temperature (Tg), and by comparing it to the folding
temperature (Tf), we find two classes of sequences: good folders with Tf≳Tg and
non‐folders with Tf<Tg.

   lowest state of a 3X3 electronic Hamiltonian. The Ar-Ar potential and
   the lower energy (IT state) B-Ar potential are very similar. In

   M. H. Alexander, and B. Hartke, J. Chem. Phys. 104, 2684 (1996)]
   proposed a global geometry optimization technique using a modified
   Genetic Algorithm approach for clusters. They refer to their technique
   as a deterministic/stochastic genetic algorithm (DS-GA). In this
   technique, the stochastic part is a traditional GA, with the
   manipulations being carried out on binary-coded internal coordinates
   (atom-atom distances). The deterministic aspect of their method is the
   inclusion of a coarse gradient descent calculation on each geometry.
   This step avoids spending a large amount of computer time searching
   parts of the configuration space which correspond to high-energy
   geometries. Their tests of the technique show it is vastly more
   efficient than searches without this local minimization. They report
   geometries for clusters of up to n = 29 Ar atoms, and find that their
   computer time scales as O(n(4.5)). In this work, we have recast the
   genetic algorithm optimization in space-fixed Cartesian coordinates,
   which scale much more favorably than internal coordinates for large
   clusters. We introduce genetic operators suited for real (base-10)
   variables. We find convergence for clusters up to n = 55. Furthermore,
   our algorithm scales as O(n(3.3)). It is concluded that genetic
   algorithm optimization in nonseparable real variables is not only
   viable, but numerically superior to that in internal candidates for
   atomic cluster calculations. Furthermore, no special choice of variable
   need be made for different cluster types; real Cartesian variables are
   readily portable, and can be used for atomic and molecular clusters

  abstract={ We present a method for reliably determining the lowest energy
    structure of an atomic cluster in an arbitrary model potential. The method
      is based on a genetic algorithm, which operates on a population of
      candidate structures to produce new candidates with lower energies. Our
      method dramatically outperforms simulated annealing, which we demonstrate
      by applying the genetic algorithm to a tight-binding model potential for
      carbon. With this potential, the algorithm efficiently finds fullerene
      cluster structures up to C60 starting from random atomic coordinates.

A spinodal is the locus of points satisfying a stability limit criterion, and
as such, invites comparison with the description of instabilities given by
catastrophe theory. We give a discussion concerning the identification of a
spinodal with a specific member of the family of elementary catastrophes and
show that the cusp catastrophe is the relevant member, a result at variance
with an earlier identification. In comparing a cusp catastrophe with the
thermodynamics of phase transitions, the comaprison should be limited to those
systems which clearly satisfy mean field theories and display a well defined
spinodal; hydrogen-in-metal systems provide the best éxperimental examples,
found so far, of such systems."

a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n=∞
an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies
(±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The
two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc
given by the condition sinh(2J/kTc) sinh(2J′/kTc)=1. The energy is a continuous
function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as -log |T-Tc|. For
strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly
with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and
Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra
which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic
properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between
areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a
strip crystal is (exp (2J/kT) tanh(2J′/kT))n.

Protein folding should be complex. Proteins organize themselves into specific
three-dimensional structures, through a myriad of conformational changes. The
classical view of protein folding describes this process as a nearly sequential
series of discrete intermediates. In contrast, the energy landscape theory of
folding considers folding as the progressive organization of an ensemble of
partially folded structures through which the protein passes on its way to the
natively folded structure. As a result of evolution, proteins have a rugged
funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. Connecting theory and
simulations of minimalist models with experiments has completely revolutionized
our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control protein folding."

The mechanically stable spatial arrangements of interacting molecules

density the number of distinguishable inherent structures rises exponentially
with system size. A more systematic analysis is presented here, using lower and
upper bounds, that leads to the same conclusion. Further examination reveals
that the characteristic exponential rise rate for inherent structure
enumeration diverges as the density approaches zero, when attractive

Experimental results from thermally annealed particles of silver and gold in
the size range 10-50 nm show the presence of re-entrant surfaces on the
decahedral multiply twinned particles (MTPs). A theoretical model is developed
to explain these results based on the Wulff construction modified to include
twin-boundaries. In addition to reproducing the re-entrant surfaces, the theory
suggests that the total surface energy of the decahedral form is sandwiched
between those of a single crystal and an icosahedral MTP. Consequently the
stability of the decahedral particles (in a certain size range) relative to
single crystals can now be explained. A useful perturbation modification is
also outlined which enables qualitative comparisons of the surface energies to
be made, and shows that the twin boundaries in MTPs limit the possible surface
facets. Explicit shapes and energies are presented for two extreme models of
the faceting. Finally, a model is outlined to justify the difference between
the structures reported here and the more common decahedra and Icosahedra—the
standard forms are artefacts of the growth process; they are not the
thermodynamically most stable structures.

picture of an assumed ideal structural glass transition. The phase transition
is a random first-order phase transition where the supercooled-liquid phase is
composed of glassy clusters separated by interfaces or domain walls. Because of
entropic driving forces the glassy clusters are continually being created and
destroyed. As the ideal transition temperature is approached the entropic
driving force vanishes and the size of the glassy clusters diverges with an
exponent of ν=2/d. All long-time dynamical processes are activated and the
Vogel-Fulcher law is obtained for the liquid-state relaxation time.

noble gases. The stable crystal for this model displays a face‐centered cubic

that a significant fraction of the curvatures become negative in the region
sampled by the system at temperatures even as low as one‐fourth the melting

respect to temperature at the melting point. We also construct and evaluate a
new distribution for the distance between the atoms in their instantaneous
dynamical configurations and those in their corresponding ‘‘quenched’’

that the quenched configurations which are encountered during the melting

it is necessary to subject the dynamical system to steepest‐descent
‘‘quenches’’ that remove thermal motion and distortion and leave the system in
the nearest mechanically stable arrangement. Such a program has been carried
out via molecular dynamics simulation on an argon‐like system containing 108
atoms. Two thermodynamic states at the same reduced density (ρ∗=1.0) were
considered, one just above the melting temperature T@B|m and one at
approximately 3.5 T∗m . Although the pair correlation functions g(r) in these
thermodynamic states differed considerably, those produced by the corresponding
sets of quenches gq(r) were virtually identical. The implied inherent structure
common to both states appears to be best described in terms of highly defective
face‐centered‐cubic crystalline configurations.

scaffold for thick-filament formation [ 1,2 ] . The titin molecule consists largely
of tandem domains of the immuno-globulin and fibronectin-III types, together
with specialized binding regions and a putative elastic region, the PEVK
domain [3]. We have done mechanical experiments on single molecules of titin to
determine their visco-elastic properties, using an optical-tweezers technique.
On a fast (0.ls) timescale titin is elastic and force–extension data can be
fitted with standard random-coil polymer models, showing that there are two
main sources of elasticity: one deriving from the entropy of straightening the
molecule; the other consistent with extension of the polypeptide chain in the
PEVK region. On a slower timescale and above a certain force threshold, the
molecule displays stress-relaxation, which occurs in rapid steps of a few
piconewtons, corresponding to yielding of internal structures by about 20 nm.
This stress-relaxation probably derives from unfolding of immu-noglobulin and
fibronectin domains.

Catastrophe theory predicts that in certain limits universal

work we investigate these relations for both first- and second-order phase
transitions, revealing that the ideal ratios often hold quite well over a wide

melting transition of an atomic cluster, the isotropic-to-nematic transition in
a liquid crystal, and the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition in the

A well-studied 46-bead protein model is the vehicle for examining principal

results of the various forms of principal coordinate analysis with results
obtained from construction of interconnected monotonic sequences of linked
stationary points (IMSLiSP) on the same surface. The conclusion is that the
most powerful formulation of principal coordinate analyses for understanding
protein folding and, in general, topographies of complex potentials, uses the
changes in the set of interparticle distances as the definition of the

256-atom supercell representation of a binary Lennard-Jones system. We then
derive analytical formulae for the number of stationary points as a function of
both system size and the Hessian index, using a framework based upon weakly
interacting subsystems. This analysis reveals a simple relation between the
total number of stationary points, the number of local minima, and the number
of transition states connected on average to each minimum. Finally we calculate
two measures of localization for the displacements corresponding to Hessian
eigenvectors in samples of stationary points obtained from the
Newton–Raphson-based geometry optimization scheme. Systematic differences are
found between the properties of eigenvectors corresponding to positive and
negative Hessian eigenvalues, and localized character is most pronounced for
stationary points with low values of the Hessian index.

Abstract = {{Our previously described diffusion equation method for global
   optimization was applied here to find minimum-energy structures of
   several clusters of identical atoms.  In this method, the potential
   energy surface of the system, which contains a large number of minima,
   is deformed (the deformation parameter being analogous to ``time{''})
   in such a way that the number of minima is decreased dramatically.  The
   deformation is carried out by finding a solution F of the diffusion
   equation for some time t, with the original potential function f as the
   boundary condition.  In the present calculations, the atoms are assumed
   to interact by means of a Lennard-Jones potential, with parameters
   pertaining to argon; however, the results can easily be rescaled to any
   other Lennard-Jones parameters.  The Lennard-Jones potential was fitted
   by a linear combination of Gaussians, so chosen to reproduce the
   potential accurately at physically relevant distances in clusters.  The
   choice of Gaussians as fitting functions allowed F to be determined
   analytically.  Further, by enforcing certain constraints on the
   Gaussian approximation of f, the following desirable behavior of F was
   guaranteed:  at sufficiently large (known) time, the interaction
   potential is purely attractive so that the minimum of F can easily be
   recognized as the only existing one; it corresponds to a collapsed
   configuration (i.e., one with all atoms occupying the same position in
   space).  Subsequent local minimizations for gradually decreasing times
   (the so-called time-reversing procedure) led rapidly to the global
   minimum of the original function.  The resulting cluster configuration
   did not depend on the number of reversing time steps when this number
   was sufficiently large (approximately 100).  The method was applied to
   several systems of up to m = 55 atoms and successfully found the global
   minimum, even in the largest of these (the 55-atom system, which
   involves minimization in the space of dimension 3m - 6 = 159 for a
   function having about 10(45) local minima).}},

abstract="Using
eigenvector-following we have calculated minima{,} transition states and
rearrangement mechanisms for face-centred-cubic (fcc) solids bound by a
Sutton-Chen (SC) Ni potential. Our results indicate that the divacancy
mechanism is the most significant factor in the upward curvature of the
Arrhenius plot for the diffusion coefficient. We were unable to identify any
true double- or correlated-jump mechanisms in either mono- or divacancy
structures. The low migration energies of interstitial defects are balanced by
high formation energies which preclude them from contributing significantly to
diffusion rates. Calculations based upon cells containing only 100 atoms have
been criticised because of the unrealistically high effective defect
concentrations when compared with a real solid at the melting point. We compare
results for cells containing 256 and 500 atoms and conclude that our calculated
stationary points are actually quite well converged."

full diagonalization of the Hessian would be the most time-consuming step, and
the second where only first derivatives of the energy are known.

Abstract = {{Roughly 3000 rearrangement pathways have been calculated for each of

   The second consists of 55 C-60 molecules with an intermolecular

   terms, as previously employed in bulk simulations. Various properties
   of the pathways are calculated, such as a cooperativity index and the
   integrated path length, and the probability distributions are subjected
   to statistical analysis. Systematic differences between the atomic
   Lennard-Jones clusters and the C-60 molecular clusters are explained in
   terms of the effective pair potential; e.g., rearrangements of
   (C-60)(5)5 are generally localized because the potential is relatively
   short ranged. A pseudo-third-derivative correction is developed to
   improve the convergence of the eigenvector-following method employed to
   optimize the geometries and follow the pathways.}},

Abstract = {{TWO protease inhibitors in human plasma play a key part in the control

   in the plasma in latent or inactive forms.  We show here that the
   reactive centre of the serpins can adopt varying conformations and that
   mobility of the reactive centre is necessary for the function of
   antithrombin and its binding and activation by heparin; the
   identification of a new locked conformation explains the latent
   inactive state of PAI-1.  This ability to vary conformation not only
   allows the modulation of inhibitory activity but also protects the
   circulating inhibitor against proteolytic attack.  Together these
   findings explain the retention by the serpins of a large and

   loop of other families of serine protease inhibitors.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal geometry of a finite cluster of atoms is difficult to find
   because the number of minima of the potential energy is huge for larger
   clusters.  Until now, the only deterministic procedure designed to find
   the lowest-energy structures of such clusters was the diffusion
   equation method, which performed well for large clusters but sometimes
   failed for smaller ones.  In the present paper we propose the so-called
   shift method (also deterministic), which deforms the original potential
   energy hypersurface by shifting the atom-atom Lennard-Jones potential. 
   As a result, the whole system collapses into a single point.  Then, by
   using the reversing procedure, the original potential is gradually
   restored while optimizing the structure for each step.  This results in
   a kind of big bang, because the atoms emerge from the collapse point
   and the cluster geometry evolves to the final one corresponding to the
   original undeformed potential.  The procedure applied to the clusters
   containing up to 19 atoms turned out to produce in all cases under
   study the structures of the lowest energy.}},

Abstract = {{In the classical molecular dynamics for a complicated system the
   trajectory remains relatively close to any arbitrarily chosen starting
   configuration of the nuclei. This is because of a prohibitively large
   volume of the configurational space as well as of energy barriers
   between numerous potential energy basins. In the present paper the
   molecular dynamics is performed on a deformed potential energy
   hypersurface. The deformation is tunable, and when increased, the
   barriers become lower or even disappear; therefore, the system is able
   to explore much larger regions of the configurational space. The
   deformation is slowly released, and finally the molecular dynamics is
   continued on the undeformed potential energy hypersurface. As a result
   of such a procedure, some low-energy structures may be found in a more
   effective way. The method has been applied to the clusters of the N
   Lennard-Jones atoms, N = 5,..., 66, which is the most extensive
   systematic study of the clusters published till now. The energies of
   the clusters are lower than those obtained by the classical molecular
   dynamics (at the same numerical effort) for the starting points being
   far away from the lowest energy region. Contrary to the molecular
   dynamics, they are independent of the starting point to a significant
   degree. The size of the most stable cluster turned out to be a stepwise
   increasing function of N, which reflects building of new atomic shells.
   However, for N = 38 some qualitative change of the structure to the one
   characteristic for the infinite crystal occurs and the cluster size
   becomes abnormally low when compared to the clusters with N < 38 and N
   > 38.y}},

   (GDA) approach of Ma and Straub {[}J. Chem. Phys 101, 533 (1994)]
   provides a set of equations of motion for Gaussian widths and centers.
   These equations are used to anneal the system from high temperature,
   with large Gaussian widths describing the particle density
   distribution, to low temperature. In order to ensure a quasiequilibrium
   throughout this process, certain constraints are imposed during the
   annealing. The results of structure optimization of van der Waals
   clusters using different variants of the GDA are compared. These
   applications demonstrate the advantage and efficiency of our method, a
   variation of the GDA algorithm, which anneals on consecutive levels of
   lower temperature. Extensions of the approach for atomic systems to
   include rigorous bond constraints in molecular clusters are also
   presented. Water cluster structures are investigated and compared with

Abstract = {{Energy landscapes hold the key to understanding a wide range of

   of the underlying energy landscape(2-7), as has the widely used
   `strong' and `fragile' classification of liquids(8-9) Here we show how
   three archetypal energy landscapes for clusters of atoms or molecules
   can be characterized in terms of the disconnectivity graphs(10) of
   their energy minima-that is, in terms of the pathways that connect
   minima at different threshold energies. First we consider a cluster of
   38 Lennard-Jones particles, whose energy landscape is a `double funnel'
   on which relaxation to the global minimum is diverted into a set of
   competing structures. Then we characterize the energy landscape
   associated with the annealing of C-60 cages to buckministerfullerene,
   and show that it provides experimentally accessible clues to the
   relaxation pathway. Finally we show a very different landscape
   morphology, that of a model water cluster (H2O)(20), and show how it
   exhibits features expected for a `strong' liquid. These three examples
   do not exhaust the possibilities, and might constitute substructures of

Geometry optimizations, rearrangement mechanisms, spectral
intensities, and tunneling splittings are reported for the water pentamer. Two
low energy degenerate rearrangements are identified for the chiral cyclic
global minimum which are analogous to processes that lead to observable
tunneling splittings in the water trimer. Fourteen different pathways are
characterized by ab initio calculations employing basis sets up to double‐zeta
plus polarization (DZP) quality with subsequent reoptimization of the
associated minima using the Becke exchange and the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation
functionals (BLYP) with the same basis. All the pathways have been recomputed
for a number of different empirical potentials, some of which reproduce the two
lowest energy degenerate rearrangements quite well. However, none of the
empirical potentials support all the higher energy ab initio minima.
Qualitative estimates of the two tunneling splittings associated with the
lowest energy pathways suggest that at least one might be observable
experimentally; the associated splitting patterns and nuclear spin weights are
also reported. The corresponding stationary points were finally reoptimized
using DZP basis sets plus diffuse functions with the BLYP exchange‐correlation
functional.

examples we consider are a two-dimensional model energy surface and binary
Lennard-Jones liquids and solids. A shortcoming of the mapping is its failure
to divide the potential energy surface into basins of attraction surrounding
saddle points, because there are many minima of ∣∇E∣2 that do not correspond to
stationary points of the potential energy. In fact, most liquid configurations
are mapped to such points for the system we consider. We therefore develop an
alternative route to investigate higher-index saddle points and obtain near
complete distributions of saddles for small Lennard-Jones clusters. The
distribution of the number of stationary points as a function of the index is
found to be Gaussian, and the average energy increases linearly with saddle
point index in agreement with previous results for bulk systems }

such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or
semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by
this criterion, the entropy theory appears more successful. It is conjectured
that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of
any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and
recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the
flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain
questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or
ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to
molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of
predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in “viscous” liquids
(shear relaxation time ≥10−9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high
compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer
be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects
are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to
provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and
relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.

on 1/gamma for values from 1-10(-1)x that of water viscosity. However, for the

	Abstract = "{Recent experiments have demonstrated that proteins unfold
when two atoms are mechanically pulled apart, and that this process is
different to when heated or when a chemical denaturant is added to the
solution. Experiments have also shown that the response of proteins to external
forces is very diverse, some of them being ``hard,'' and others ``soft.''
Mechanical resistance originates from the presence of barriers on the energy
landscape; together, experiment and simulation have demonstrated that unfolding
occurs through alternative pathways when different pairs of atoms undergo
mechanical extension. Here we use simulation to probe the mechanical resistance
of six structurally diverse proteins when pulled in different directions. For
this, we use two very different models: a detailed, transferable one, and a
coarse-grained, structure-based one. The coarse-grained model gives results
that are surprisingly similar to the detailed one and qualitatively agree with
experiment; i.e., the mechanical resistance of different proteins or of a
single protein pulled in different directions can be predicted by simulation.

we examined the folding mechanisms of segment B1 peptostreptococcal protein L

symmetrical topology. Despite this symmetry, neither protein folds through a
symmetrical transition state. We analyzed the origins of this difference using
theoretical models. We found that the strength of the interactions present in
the N-terminal hairpin of protein L causes this hairpin to form ahead of the
C-terminal hairpin. The difference in chain entropy associated with the
formation of the hairpins of protein G proves sufficient to beget initiation of
folding at the shorter C-terminal hairpin. Our findings suggest that the
mechanism of folding may be understood by examination of the free energy
associated with the formation of partially folded microstates.}"

extensible unfolding of red cell spectrins as monomeric constructs of just two,
three, or four repeats from the actin-binding ends of both alpha-and
beta-chains, i.e., alpha(18-21) and beta(1-4) or their subfragments. In
addition to single repeat unfolding evident in sawtooth patterns peaked at
relatively low forces (<50 pN at 1 nm/ms extension rates), tandem, repeat
unfolding is also demonstrated in ensemble-scale analyses of thousands of
atomic force microscopy contacts. Evidence for extending two chains and loops
is provided by force versus length scatterplots which also indicate that tandem

The unfolding of a protein by the application of an external force pulling two

technologies as have been broadly demonstrated in the past decade. Variation of
the applied force results in a modulation of the free-energy barrier to
unfolding and thus, the rate of the process, which is often assumed to have
single exponential kinetics. It has been recently shown that it is
experimentally feasible, through the use of force clamps, to estimate the
distribution of unfolding times for a population of proteins initially in the
native state. In this Letter we show how the analysis of such distributions
under a range of forces can provide unique information about the underlying

time scales are therefore within reach. To encourage applications, the model is
kept very simple. Only a small number of coarse grained atom types are defined,
which interact using a few discrete levels of interaction. Despite the
computational speed and the simplistic nature of the model, it proves to be
both versatile in its applications and accurate in its predictions. We show
that densities of liquid alkanes from decane up to eicosane can be reproduced
to within 5\%, and the mutual solubilities of alkanes in water and water in
alkanes can be reproduced within 0.5 kT of the experimental values. The CG
model for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is shown to aggregate
spontaneously into a bilayer. Structural properties such as the area per
headgroup and the phosphate-phosphate distance match the experimentally
measured quantities closely. The same is true for elastic properties such as
the bending modulus and the area compressibility, and dynamic properties such
as the lipid lateral diffusion coefficient and the water permeation rate. The
distribution of the individual lipid components along the bilayer normal is
very similar to distributions obtained from atomistic simulations.
Phospholipids with different headgroup (ethanolamine) or different tail lengths
(lauroyl, stearoyl) or unsaturated tails (oleoyl) can also be modeled with the
CG force field. The experimental area per headgroup can be reproduced for most
lipids within 0.02 nm(2). Finally, the CG model is applied to nonbilayer

The study of mechanical unfolding, through the combined efforts of atomic force

landscapes of proteins. Thus far, experiments have been mostly analyzed with
one-dimensional models of the free-energy landscape. We show that as the two
ends of a protein, filamin, are pulled apart at a speed tending to zero, the
measured mechanical strength plateaus at ∼30 pN instead of going toward zero,
deviating from the Bell model. The deviation can only be explained by a switch
between parallel pathways. Insightful analysis of mechanical unfolding kinetics
needs to account for the multidimensionality of the free-energy landscapes of
proteins, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of proteins under
the small forces experienced in vivo.}

Furthermore, the elastic response of macromolecules to an applied force is the
foundation of the single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques. The two main
classes of models describing chain elasticity include the worm-like and freely
jointed chain models. The selection between these two classes of models is
based on the assumptions about chain flexibility. In many experimental
situations, the choice is not clear, and a model describing the crossover
between these two limiting classes is therefore in high demand. We are
proposing a unified chain deformation model that describes the
force−deformation curve in terms of the chain bending constant, K, and bond
length, b. This model demonstrates that the worm-like and freely jointed chain
models correspond to two different regimes of polymer deformation, and the
crossover between these two regimes depends on the chain bending rigidity and
the magnitude of the applied force. Polymer chains with bending constant K > 1
behave as a worm-like chain under tension in the interval of the applied forces
f ≤ KkBT/b and as a freely jointed chain for f ≥ KkBT/b. (kB is the Boltzmann
constant and T is the absolute temperature.) The proposed crossover expression
for chain deformation is in excellent agreement with the results of the

persistence length) and chain length. The FRC model is a first step toward the
understanding of the stretching behavior of synthetic polymers, denatured

scaling results for the force response of the elastically jointed chain EJC

joints with some bending stiffness; this is the discretized version of the
continuum WLC model. The EJC model might be applicable to stiff biopolymers

the WLC to the DC behavior, which occurs at a force f/k(B)T similar to l/b(2)

We show that the electrostatic repulsion between charged monomers leads to an
intrinsic stretching force, which cannot be neglected for low salt

external forces as the salt concentration is decreased, in agreement with
experiments. Because of the scale dependence of the electrostatic contribution
to the persistence length, the effective persistence length (obtained from
fitting the high-force stretching response to a semiflexible chain model)
acquires a force dependence which follows a universal heuristic scaling
function. As a consequence, flexible (synthetic) polyelectrolytes are
characterized by their bare persistence length in the piconewton force range,
while the effective persistence length of double-stranded DNA contains
additional electrostatic contributions in the same force range as was found in
recent experiments. The coupling between elongational and bending fluctuations
leads to a force renormalization which is particularly important close to
conformational phase transitions or bond failure. Finally, these perturbative
results are supplemented by quantum-chemical ab initio calculations for the
stretching response of polymers, giving an elastic modulus of 28 nN for fully

reported B-S transition, where `S' represents an overstretched conformation, at
65 pN is followed by a nonequilibrium melting transition at 150 pN. During this
transition the DNA is split into single strands that fully recombine upon
relaxation, The sequence dependence was investigated in comparative studies
with poly(dG-dC) and poly(dA-dT) DNA. Both the B-S and the melting transition
occur at significantly lower forces in poly(dA-dT) compared to poly(dG-dC). We
made use of the melting transition to prepare single poly(dG-dC) and
poly(dA-dT) DNA strands that upon relaxation reannealed into hairpins as a
result of their self-complementary sequence. The unzipping of these hairpins
directly revealed the base pair-unbinding forces for G-C to be 20 +/- 3 pN and
for A-T to be 9 +/- 3 pN.}"

length is proportional to the Debye screening length. This result is obtained
by evaluating the bending angle fluctuations and in the framework of the
Gaussian variational principle. A polyelectrolyte chain with linear dependence
of the electrostatic persistence length on the Debye screening length has a
lower free energy than that of a chain with the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman
electrostatic persistence length. In the case of weakly charged chains the
electrostatic persistence length has a sublinear dependence on the Debye
screening length which is due to inverse logarithmic dependence of the linear
charge density of the chain of electrostatic blobs on the Debye screening
length. This result was derived by applying a coarse-graining procedure to an
initially flexible polyelectrolyte chain by representing it as a chain of
electrostatic blobs. The blob size and chain persistence length are then found
self-consistently by minimizing the chain's variational free energy.}"

Significant advances in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual
framework for describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The sizes
of proteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding
transition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and
timescales of folding are, to a large extent, determined by N, the number of
residues. The intricate details of folding as a function of denaturant
concentration can be predicted by using a novel coarse-grained molecular
transfer model. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using single-molecule
methods, investigators have established the validity of the theoretically
anticipated heterogeneity in the folding routes and the N-dependent timescales
for the three stages in the approach to the native state. Despite the successes
of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, we conclude that
much remains to be done to solve the protein folding problem in the broadest
sense. } }

Single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments, and a number of other physical

state under the action of a steadily increasing external force. The main
observable in such experiments is the distribution of the forces, at which the
escape events occur. The challenge in interpreting the experimental data is to
relate them to the microscopic system properties. We work out a maximum
likelihood approach and show that it is the optimal method to tackle this
problem. When fitting actual experimental data it is unavoidable to assume some
functional form for the force-dependent escape rate. Focusing on escape
processes over a single activation barrier, we consider a quite general and
common such functional form and demonstrate by means of data from a realistic
computer experiment that the maximum number of fit parameters that can be
determined reliably is three. They are related to the force-free escape rate
and the position and height of the activation barrier. Furthermore, the results
for the first two of these fit parameters show little dependence on the
assumption about the manner in which the barrier decreases with the applied
force, while the last one, the barrier height in the absence of force, depends
strongly on this assumption." }

The elastic protein titin comprises a tandem array of fibronectin type III and
immunoglobulin domains, which are structurally similar 7-strand
beta-sandwiches. A proposed mechanism for stretching titin, by sequential
denaturation of individual fibronectin type III-immunoglobulin domains in
response to applied tension, is analyzed here quantitatively. The folded domain
is approximately 4 nm long, and the unraveled polypeptide can extend to 29 nm,
providing a 7-fold stretch over the relaxed length. Elastic recoil is achieved
by refolding of the denatured domains when the force is released. The critical
force required to denature a domain is calculated to be 3.5-5 pN, based on a
net free energy for denaturation of 7-14 kcal/mol, plus 5 kcal/mol to extend
the polypeptide (1 cal = 4.184 J). This force is comparable to the 2- to 7-pN
force generated by single myosin or kinesin molecules. The force needed to pull
apart a noncovalent protein-protein interface is estimated here to be 10-30 pN,
implying that titin will stretch internally before the molecule is pulled from
its attachment at the Z band. Many extracellular matrix and cell adhesion
molecules, such as fibronectin, contain tandem arrays of fibronectin type III
domains. Both single molecules and matrix fibers should have elastic properties
similar to titin }

Titin, a giant filamentous polypeptide, is believed to play a fundamental role
in maintaining sarcomeric structural integrity and developing what is known as
passive force in muscle. Measurements of the force required to stretch a single
molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The
molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons
and refolds in a low-force transition at ∼2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the
molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike
chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain’s bending rigidity) of
20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding
and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release
rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to
sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force versus

Since to form a hole the size of a molecule in a liquid requires almost the

vapor above the liquid is a measure of such ``molecular'' holes in the liquid.
This provides an explanation of the law of rectilinear diameters of Cailletet
and Mathias. The theory of reaction rates yields an equation for absolute
viscosity applicable to cases involving activation energies where the usual
theory of energy transfer does not apply. This equation reduces to a number of
the successful empirical equations under the appropriate limiting conditions.
The increase of viscosity with shearing stress is explained. The same theory
yields an equation for the diffusion coefficient which when combined with the
viscosity and applied to the results of Orr and Butler for the diffusion of
heavy into light water gives a satisfactory and suggestive interpretation. The
usual theories for diffusion coefficients and absolute electrical conductance
should be replaced by those developed here when ion and solvent molecule are of
about the same size

We propose an analytical approach to describe the active rebinding and force

for dependences of the measured quantities on the properties of molecular
potential, effective stiffness of the pulling spring, and the pulling velocity.
The calculations predict that the energy dissipated per an unbinding-rebinding
cycle strongly increases with the steepness of the molecular potential and with
decreasing the spring stiffness. A comparison of analytical results with
Langevin simulations shows that the scaling relations for the barrier heights
and most probable forces are more accurate in the case of active rebinding than
for unbinding. Our consideration demonstrates that simultaneous analysis of
probability density functions for unbinding and rebinding forces improves
essentially the accuracy of retrieval information on intrinsic parameters of
the molecular complex from the force measurements.  }

extent of the topological control of the folding process, we studied the
folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using
a Go-like potential to retain the information about the native structures but
drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among
residue-residue native interactions. By comparing the structure of the
transition state ensemble (experimentally determined by Phi-values) and of the
intermediates with those obtained using our models, we show that these
energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known
features of the transition state ensembles and "en-route" intermediates, at
least for the analyzed proteins. This result clearly indicates that, as long as
the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated, topology plays a
central role in determining the folding mechanism.

polar hydrogen representation with an implicit solvation model. The latter
provides an adiabatic solvent response, which is important for the nanosecond
unfolding simulation method used here. A series of simulations is performed for
each system to obtain meaningful results. The two different fibronectin domains
are shown to unfold in the same way along two possible pathways. These involve
the partial separation of the 'beta-sandwich', an essential structural
element, and the unfolding of the individual sheets in a stepwise fashion. The
biasing potential results are confirmed by constant force unfolding
simulations. For the two connected domains, there is complete unfolding of one
domain (9Fn3) before major unfolding of the second domain (10Fn3). Comparison
of different models for the potential energy function demonstrates that the
dominant cohesive element in both proteins is due to the attractive van der
Waals interactions; electrostatic interactions play a structural role but
appear to make only a small contribution to the stabilization of the domains,
in agreement with other studies of [beta]-sheet stability. The unfolding forces
found in the simulations are of the order of those observed experimentally,
even though the speed of the former is more than six orders of magnitude
greater than that used in the latter."

assemblies of proteins are used extensively throughout biology to provide
structures that are mechanically strong and yet not brittle. Examples include
the triple coiled coil of collagen, the β-sheets of silk, and the coiled coil
rods of keratin, a protein found in nails, claws, and skin tissue. More
recently, it has been realised that at a cellular and subcellular level, there
are also many proteins whose function requires them to resist mechanical
deformation. Indeed at the subcellular (nanoscale) level, force is ubiquitous
and is not only important in systems with a clear mechanical function such as
processive motors that run on tracks (e.g., myosin-actin and
kinesin-microtubules) but is also thought to play a role in
mechano-signalling1, fibrillogenesis1, and protein degradation2. At this length
scale, many protein systems that react to force are either monomeric or are
expressed as tandem arrays of domains with closely related topologies.},

the human muscle protein titin (TI I27) has been shown to proceed via a
metastable intermediate in which the A-strand is detached. The structure and
properties of this intermediate are characterised in this study. A conservative
destabilising mutation in the A-strand has no effect on the unfolding force,
nor the dependence of the unfolding force on the pulling speed, indicating that
the unfolding forces measured in an AFM experiment are those required for the
unfolding of the intermediate and not the native state. A mutant of TI I27 with
the A-strand deleted (TI I27 - A) is studied by NMR and standard biophysical
techniques, combined with protein engineering. Molecular dynamics simulations
show TI I27 - A to be a good model for the intermediate. It has a structure
very similar to the native state, and is surprisingly stable. Comparison with a
Phi-value analysis of the unfolding pathway clearly shows that the protein
unfolds by a different pathway under an applied force than on addition of
denaturant. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}"

Titin I27 shows a high resistance to unfolding when subject to external force.
To investigate the molecular basis of this mechanical stability, protein
engineering [Phi]-value analysis has been combined with atomic force microscopy
to investigate the structure of the barrier to forced unfolding. The results
indicate that the transition state for forced unfolding is significantly
structured, since highly destabilising mutations in the core do not affect the
force required to unfold the protein. As has been shown before, mechanical
strength lies in the region of the A' and G-strands but, contrary to previous
suggestions, the results indicate clearly that side-chain interactions play a
significant role in maintaining mechanical stability. Since [Phi]-values
calculated from molecular dynamics simulations are the same as those determined
experimentally, we can, with confidence, use the molecular dynamics simulations
to analyse the structure of the transition state in detail, and are able to
show loss of interactions between the A' and G-strands with associated A-B and
E-F loops in the transition state. The key event is not a simple case of loss
of hydrogen bonding interactions between the A' and G-strands alone. Comparison
with [Phi]-values from traditional folding studies shows differences between
the force and 'no-force' transition states but, nevertheless, the region
important for kinetic stability is the same in both cases. This explains the
correspondence between hierarchy of kinetic stability (measured in stopped-flow
denaturant studies) and mechanical strength in these titin domains." }

Molecular simulations are carried out on the Immunoglobulin 27 domain of the
titin protein. The energy landscape is mapped out using an implicit solvent
model, and molecular dynamics simulations are run with the solvent explicitly
modeled. Stretching a protein is shown to produce a dynamic energy landscape in
which the energy minima move in configuration space, change in depth, and are
created and destroyed. The connections of these landscape changes to the
mechanical unfolding of the Immunoglobulin 27 domain are addressed. Hydrogen
bonds break upon stretching by either intrabasin processes associated with the
movement of energy minima, or interbasin processes associated with transitions
between energy minima. Intrabasin changes are reversible and dominate for
flexible interactions, whereas interbasin changes are irreversible and dominate
for stiff interactions. The most flexible interactions are Glu-Lys salt
bridges, which can act like tethers to bind strands even after all backbone
interactions between the strands have been broken. As the protein is stretched,
different types of structures become the lowest energy structures, including
structures that incorporate nonnative hydrogen bonds. Structures that have flat
energy versus elongation profiles become the lowest energy structures at
elongations of several Angstroms, and are associated with the unfolding
intermediate state observed experimentally." }

mechanical forces without unfolding. Recently it has been suggested [Eom, K.;
Li, P.-C.; Makarov, D. E.; Rodin, G. J. J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 8730] that
the “clamp” formed by the parallel strands in this domain represents an optimal
topology maximizing the mechanical strength of cross-linked polymer chains.
Here we use simulations to demonstrate that protein G IgG-binding domain III
and ubiquitin, both exhibiting a parallel strand arrangement similar to that in
I27 but otherwise having a distinctly different fold and not involved in an
obvious load-bearing function, exhibit high resistance to mechanical unfolding.
Using molecular dynamics simulations, we compute the potential of mean force as
a function of the distance between the domains' C- and N-termini and use
transition state theory to calculate the force-dependent rates of unfolding. We
further predict the outcome of a hypothetical single-molecule AFM pulling
experiment, in which one of the I27 domains in titin is replaced by one of the
above two proteins. For typical AFM pulling rates, the predicted unfolding
force is in the range 190−220 pN for ubiquitin and 100−150 pN for the
IgG-binding domain. } }
