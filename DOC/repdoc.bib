	abstract = "We have studied the folding mechanism of lattice model 36-mer proteins. Using a simulated annealing procedure in sequence space, we have designed sequences to have sufficiently low energy in a given target conformation, which plays the role of the native structure in our study. The sequence design algorithm generated sequences for which the native structures is a pronounced global energy minimum. Then, designed sequences were subjected to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of folding. In each run, starting from a random coil conformation, the chain reached its native structure, which is indicative that the model proteins solve the Levinthal paradox. The folding mechanism involved nucleation growth. Formation of a specific nucleus, which is a particular pattern of contacts, is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for subsequent rapid folding to the native state. The nucleus represents a transition state of folding to the molten globule conformation. The search for the nucleus is a rate-limiting step of folding and corresponds to overcoming the major free energy barrier. We also observed a folding pathway that is the approach to the native state after nucleus formation; this stage takes about 1\% of the simulation time. The nucleus is a spatially localized substructure of the native state having 8 out of 40 native contacts. However, monomers belonging to the nucleus are scattered along the sequence, so that several nucleus contacts are long-range while other are short-range. A folding nucleus was also found in a longer chain 80-mer, where it also constituted 20\% of the native structure. The possible mechanism of folding of designed proteins, as well as the experimental implications of this study is discussed.",

Moreover, by decreasing T, the saddle order vanishes at the same temperature (TMCT) where the inverse diffusivity appears to diverge as a power law. This allows a topological interpretation of TMCT: it marks the transition from a dynamics between basins of saddles (T>TMCT) to a dynamics between basins of minima (T<TMCT). ",

The simple equations in the stationary frame can be analyzed using the Onsager-Machlup theory for stochastic systems and provide generalizations of equilibrium and near equilibrium concepts such as detailed balance and fluctuation-dissipation relations applicable to a wide range of systems including molecular motors, pumps, and other nanoscale machines ",

This procedure uniquely identifies a non-Gaussian distribution of the observable associated with each local equilibrium state (LES). Both the number of LESs and the shape of the non-Gaussian distributions depend on the time scale of observation. By assessing how often the system visits and resides in a chosen LES and escapes from one LES to another (with checking whether the local detailed balance is satisfied), our scheme naturally leads to an effective free energy landscape whose topography depends on in which time scale the system experiences the underlying landscape. For example, two metastable states are unified as one if the time scale of observation is longer than the escape time scale for which the system can visit mutually these two states. As an illustrative example, we present the application of extracting the effective free energy landscapes from time series of the end-to-end distance of a three-color, 46-bead model protein. It indicates that the time scales to attain the local equilibrium tend to be longer in the unfolded state than those in the compact collapsed state.",

	abstract = "The unbinding dynamics of complexes involving cell-adhesion molecules depends on the specific ligands. Atomic force microscopy measurements have shown that for the specific P-selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (sPSGL-1) the average bond lifetime t initially increases (catch bonds) at low (< or =10 pN) constant force, f, and decreases when f > 10 pN (slip bonds). In contrast, for the complex with G1 anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody t monotonically decreases with f. To quantitatively map the energy landscape of such complexes we use a model that considers the possibility of redistribution of population from one force-free state to another force-stabilized bound state. The excellent agreement between theory and experiments allows us to extract energy landscape parameters by fitting the calculated curves to the lifetime measurements for both sPSGL-1 and G1. Surprisingly, the unbinding transition state for P-selectin-G1 complex is close (0.32 nm) to the bound state, implying that the interaction is brittle, i.e., once deformed, the complex fractures. In contrast, the unbinding transition state of the P-selectin-sPSGL-1 complex is far (approximately 1.5 nm) from the bound state, indicative of a compliant structure. Constant f energy landscape parameters are used to compute the distributions of unbinding times and unbinding forces as a function of the loading rate, rf. For a given rf, unbinding of sPSGL-1 occurs over a broader range of f with the most probable f being an order of magnitude less than for G1. The theory for cell adhesion complexes can be used to predict the outcomes of unbinding of other protein-protein complexes.",

This map partitions conformation space into energy-dependent or temperature-dependent `'attraction basins'' and generates `'disconnectivity'' graph that reflects the basin connectivity and characterizes the shape of the multidimensional surface. The partitioning of the conformation space is used to express the temporal behavior of the system in terms of basin-to-basin kinetics instead of the usual state-to-state transitions. For this purpose the transition matrix of the system is expressed in terms of basin-to-basin transitions and the corresponding master equation is solved. As an example, the approach is applied to the tetrapeptide, isobutyryl-(ala)(3)-NH-methyl (IAN), which is the shortest peptide that can form a full helical turn. A nearly complete List of minima and barriers is available for this system from the work of Czerminiski and Elber. The multidimensional potential energy surface of the peptide is shown to exhibit an overall `'funnel'' shape. The relation between connectivity and spatial proximity in dihedral angle space is examined. It is found that, although the two are similar, closeness in one does not always imply closeness in the other. The basin to basin kinetics is examined using a master equation and the results are interpreted in terms of kinetic connectivity. The conformation space of the peptide is divided up in terms of the surface topography to model its `'folding'' behavior. Even in this very simple system, the kinetics exhibit a `'trapping'' state which appears as a `'kinetic intermediate,'' as in the folding of proteins. The approach described here can be used more generally to classify multidimensional potential energy surface sand the time development of complex systems. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.}",

	abstract = " The variational transition state theory approach for dissipative systems is extended in a new direction. An explicit solution is provided for the optimal planar dividing surface for multidimensional dissipative systems whose equations of motion are given in terms of coupled generalized Langevin equations. In addition to the usual dependence on friction, the optimal planar dividing surface is temperature dependent. This temperature dependence leads to a temperature dependent barrier frequency whose zero temperature limit in the one dimensional case is just the usual Kramers--Grote--Hynes reactive frequency. In this way, the Kramers--Grote--Hynes equation for the barrier frequency is generalized to include the effect of nonlinearities in the system potential. Consideration of the optimal planar dividing surface leads to a unified treatment of a variety of problems. These are (a) extension of the Kramers--Grote--Hynes theory for the transmission coefficient to include finite barrier heights, (b) generalization of Langer’s theory for multidimensional systems to include both memory friction and finite barrier height corrections, (c) Langer’s equation for the reactive frequency in the multidimensional case is generalized to include the dependence on friction and the nonlinearity of the multidimensional potential, (d) derivation of the non‐Kramers limit for the transmission coefficient in the case of anisotropic friction, (e) the generalized theory allows for the possibility of a shift of the optimal planar dividing surface away from the saddle point, this shift is friction and temperature dependent, (f) a perturbative solution of the generalized equations is presented for the one and two dimensional cases and applied to cubic and quartic potentials.

So far, mechanical information about molecular bond mechanics has been largely limited to a single direction of force application. However, mechanical force acts as a vector in space and hence mechanical stability should depend on the direction of force application. In skeletal muscle, the giant protein titin is anchored in the Z-disk by telethonin. Much of the structural integrity of the Z-disk hinges upon the titin-telethonin bond. In this paper we show that the complex between the muscle proteins titin and telethonin forms a highly directed molecular bond. It is designed to resist ultra-high forces if they are applied in the direction along which it is loaded under physiological conditions, while it breaks easily along other directions. Highly directed molecular bonds match in an ideal way the requirements of tissues subject to mechanical stress.",

	abstract = " Titin I27 shows a high resistance to unfolding when subject to external force. To investigate the molecular basis of this mechanical stability, protein engineering [Phi]-value analysis has been combined with atomic force microscopy to investigate the structure of the barrier to forced unfolding. The results indicate that the transition state for forced unfolding is significantly structured, since highly destabilising mutations in the core do not affect the force required to unfold the protein. As has been shown before, mechanical strength lies in the region of the A' and G-strands but, contrary to previous suggestions, the results indicate clearly that side-chain interactions play a significant role in maintaining mechanical stability. Since [Phi]-values calculated from molecular dynamics simulations are the same as those determined experimentally, we can, with confidence, use the molecular dynamics simulations to analyse the structure of the transition state in detail, and are able to show loss of interactions between the A' and G-strands with associated A-B and E-F loops in the transition state. The key event is not a simple case of loss of hydrogen bonding interactions between the A' and G-strands alone. Comparison with [Phi]-values from traditional folding studies shows differences between the force and 'no-force' transition states but, nevertheless, the region important for kinetic stability is the same in both cases. This explains the correspondence between hierarchy of kinetic stability (measured in stopped-flow denaturant studies) and mechanical strength in these titin domains.",

Determining intrinsic kinetic information, at zero stretching force, usually requires an extrapolation by fitting a theoretical model. Here, we apply a recent theoretical approach describing molecular rupture in the presence of force to unfolding kinetic data obtained from coarse-grained simulations of ubiquitin. Unfolding rates calculated from simulations over a broad range of stretching forces, for different pulling directions, reveal a remarkable "turnover" from a force-independent process at low force to a force-dependent process at high force, akin to the "roll-over" in unfolding rates sometimes seen in studies using chemical denaturant. While such a turnover in rates is unexpected in one dimension, we demonstrate that it can occur for dynamics in just two dimensions. We relate the turnover to the quality of the pulling direction as a reaction coordinate for the intrinsic folding mechanism. A novel pulling direction, designed to be the most relevant to the intrinsic folding pathway, results in the smallest turnover. Our results are in accord with protein engineering experiments and simulations which indicate that the unfolding mechanism at high force can differ from the intrinsic mechanism. The apparent similarity between extrapolated and intrinsic rates in experiments, unexpected for different unfolding barriers, can be explained if the turnover occurs at low forces.},

For weak effective coupling between residues ( i.e., high temperatures) the folding time is mainly controlled by the free energy gradient. When this coupling is strong, entrapment in local minima plays a major role. The energy gap separating the native state from the remaining conformations shows some correlation to the folding and unfolding times for a variety of sequences. These concepts are related to the ratio Tf/Tg proposed by Bryngelson and Wolynes. One source of local minima are strong, non‐native (hindering) contacts. An exclusive increase in hindering contacts shows a strong correlation between the energy gap and the folding/unfolding times. Other local minima results from several native contacts that, if formed prematurely, interfere with the formation of others. To study these factors, we use a semispecific model characterized by attractive interactions between similar residues. A procedure to design stabler sequences with smoother landscapes is discussed. By comparing this model to the hydrophobic HP model, we show how higher potential heterogeneity can be used to improve folding. ",

	abstract = "Atomic force spectroscopy has become a widely used technique for investigating forces, energies, and dynamics of biomolecular interactions. These studies provide dissociation kinetic parameters by pulling apart proteins involved in a complex. Biological complexes are studied under near-physiological conditions, without labeling procedures, and are probed one at time, the latter allowing to one obtain results which are not averaged over the ensemble. However, to gain reliable information, some experimental aspects have to be carefully controlled. In particular, the immobilization of molecular partners to AFM tips and supports, required to force the molecular dissociation, plays a crucial role in determining the success of the experiments. To actually resolve single interactions, multiple simultaneous complex dissociations have to be avoided, and nonspecific adhesions, commonly found in these studies, have to be recognized and discarded. This article is aimed at offering a critical revisitation of the atomic force spectroscopy technique applied to the study of biomolecular interactions, highlighting the critical points, identifying strategies to be adopted for a more reliable data extraction and interpretation, and pointing out the experimental and theoretical aspects which still need to be refined. To this purpose, we take advantage of the vast landscape of literature and then proceed into the details of our works. In this respect, we describe the general principles of the technique, the procedures for protein immobilization, and how they can affect the results. We emphasize the use of computational docking to predict molecular complex configurations, when unknown, as a useful approach to select proper anchorage architectures. Additionally, we deal with data acquirement and analysis, with regard to the force curve selection, to the force histograms interpretation, and to the theoretical frameworks used to extract kinetic parameters. Through this, we outline that AFS can be successfully used both to investigate complexes having very different affinities and also to reveal competitive binding mechanisms, thus gaining deeper information about molecular interactions.",

The time course of protection from exchange has been measured for 26 backbone amide protons that form stable hydrogen bonds upon refolding and exchange slowly under native conditions. Amide protons in the beta-sheet and the alpha-helix, as well as protons involved in hydrogen bonds at the helix/sheet interface, become 80\% protected in an initial 8-ms folding phase, indicating that the two elements of secondary structure form and associate in a common cooperative folding event. Somewhat slower protection rates for residues 59, 61, and 69 provide evidence for the subsequent stabilization of a surface loop. Most probes also exhibit two minor phases with time constants of about 100 ms and 10 s. Only two of the observed residues, Gln-41 and Arg-42, display significant slow folding phases, with amplitudes of 37\% and 22\%, respectively, which can be attributed to native-like folding intermediates containing cis peptide bonds for Pro-37 and/or Pro-38.

We determine that the model for protein G exhibits an early intermediate that precedes the rate-limiting barrier of folding, and which draws together misaligned secondary structure elements that are stabilized by hydrophobic core contacts involving the third P-strand, and presages the later transition state in which the correct strand alignment of these same secondary structure elements is restored. Finally, the validity of the targeted intermediate ensemble for protein G was analyzed by fitting the kinetic data to a two-step first-order reversible reaction, proving that protein G folding involves an on-pathway early intermediate, and should be populated and therefore observable by experiment.}",

	abstract = "The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions.",

The overall framework of minimization is the same except for the choice of directions for updating the quasi-Newton Hessian. Ideally these directions are chosen so the updated Hessian gives steps that are same as using the Newton method. Three approaches to determine the directions for updating are presented: the straightforward approach of simply cycling through the Cartesian unit vectors (finite difference), a concurrent set of minimizations, and the Lanczos method. We show the importance of using preconditioning and a multiple secant update in these approaches. For the Lanczos algorithm, an initial set of directions is required to start the method, and a number of possibilities are explored. To test the methods we used the standard 50-dimensional analytic Rosenbrock function. Results are also reported for the histidine dipeptide, the isoleucine tripeptide, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate. All of these systems show a significant speed-up with the number of processors up to about eight processors. ",

The kinetics are probed by several correlation functions and are interpreted in terms of the underlying energy landscape. The transition from the coil to the native state occurs in three distinct stages. The initial stage corresponds to a random collapse of the protein chain. At intermediate times tau c, during which much of the native structure is acquired, there are multiple pathways. For longer times tau r (>> tau c) the decay is exponential, suggestive of a late transition state. The folding time scale (approximately tau r) varies greatly depending on the model.

Both inhibitors are members of the serpin family and both exist in the plasma in latent or inactive forms. We show here that the reactive centre of the serpins can adopt varying conformations and that mobility of the reactive centre is necessary for the function of antithrombin and its binding and activation by heparin; the identification of a new locked conformation explains the latent inactive state of PAI-1. This ability to vary conformation not only allows the modulation of inhibitory activity but also protects the circulating inhibitor against proteolytic attack. Together these findings explain the retention by the serpins of a large and unconstrained reactive centre as compared to the small fixed peptide loop of other families of serine protease inhibitors.}",

By engineering a protein made of tandem repeats of identical Ig modules, we were able to get explicit AFM data on the unfolding rate of a single protein domain that can be accurately extrapolated to zero force. We compare this with chemical unfolding rates for untethered modules extrapolated to 0 M denaturant. The unfolding rates obtained by the two methods are the same. Furthermore, the transition state for unfolding appears at the same position on the folding pathway when assessed by either method. These results indicate that mechanical unfolding of a single protein by AFM does indeed reflect the same event that is observed in traditional unfolding experiments. The way is now open for the extensive use of AFM to measure folding reactions at the single-molecule level. Single-molecule AFM recordings have the added advantage that they define the reaction coordinate and expose rare unfolding events that cannot be observed in the absence of chemical denaturants.",

The method is illustrated by application to a two dimensional model problem, to the vinylidene-acetylene rearrangement (H,C = C:\_HC=:CH), and to the dissociation and rearrangement of formaldehyde (H,CO\_H, + CO, HCOH). The algorithm is also seen to provide an improved way of following a reaction path from a transition state down to reactants or products. },

HH contacts are favorable. The conformational landscape is found by exhaustive enumeration using two different move sets, and time evolution is modeled by a transition matrix with the Metropolis criterion. The kinetic sequence of folding events depends strongly on both the monomer sequence and on the move set. But certain features are common to all sequences with both move sets. Beginning with open conformations, chains fold through multiple paths, are slowed by kinetic traps, and accumulate in compact nonnative conformations. Most chains must surmount energy barriers, which we identify as the transition state. Strikingly, the transition state involves a chain expansion, due to the breaking of HH contacts of compact denatured conformations. Mutations can significantly affect the energy landscape and folding dynamics, but in ways that appear too subtle to predict just from knowledge of native structures. Consistent with other models, we find that sequences with a large energy gap between the native and the next higher energy level can be stable and fold rapidly ",

We find that any self-avoiding flexible polymer molecule will develop large amounts of secondary structure, helices and parallel and antiparallel sheets, as it is driven to increasing compactness by any force of attraction among the chain monomers. Thus structure formation arises from the severity of steric constraints in compact polymers. This steric principle of organization can account for why short helices are stable in globular proteins, why there are parallel and anti-parallel sheets in proteins, and why weakly unfolded proteins have some secondary structure. On this basis, it should be possible to construct copolymers, not necessarily using amino acids, that can collapse to maximum compactness in incompatible solvents and that should then have structural organization resembling that of proteins.",

For a loading rate beyond the upper limit of the scaling regime, the bond rupture is deterministic and the thermal effects are negligible. For a loading rate below the lower limit of the scaling regime, the contribution from rebinding becomes important and there is no simple scaling relation between the rupture force and the loading rate. Our theory takes the effect of rebinding in the calculation, therefore we find good agreement between theory and simulation even below the scaling regime. ",

To assess the quality of structural reaction coordinates in predicting the transition-state ensemble (TSE) of protein folding, we benchmarked the accuracy of four structural reaction coordinates against the kinetic measure P fold, whose value of 0.50 defines the stochastic separatrix for a two-state folding mechanism. For two proteins that fold by a simple two-state mechanism, c-src SH3 and CI-2, the {\^I}¦-values of the TSEs predicted by native topology-based reaction coordinates (including Q, the fraction of native contacts) are almost identical to those of the TSE based on P fold, with correlation coefficients of >0.90. For proteins with complex folding mechanisms that have especially broad, asymmetrical free energy barriers such as the designed 3-ankyrin repeating protein (3ANK) or proteins with distinct intermediates such as cyanovirin-N (CV-N), we show that the ensemble of structures with P fold = 0.50 generally does not include the chemically relevant transition states. This weakness of P fold limits its usefulness in protein folding studies. For such systems, elucidating the essential features of folding mechanisms requires using multiple reaction coordinates, although the number is still rather small. At the same time, for simple folding mechanisms, there is no indication of superiority for P fold over structurally chosen and thermodynamically relevant reaction coordinates that correctly measure the degree of nativeness.",

To investigate the extent of the topological control of the folding process, we studied the folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using a Go-like potential to retain the information about the native structures but drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among residue-residue native interactions. By comparing the structure of the transition state ensemble (experimentally determined by Phi-values) and of the intermediates with those obtained using our models, we show that these energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known features of the transition state ensembles and "en-route" intermediates, at least for the analyzed proteins. This result clearly indicates that, as long as the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated, topology plays a central role in determining the folding mechanism. }

These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects-features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.",

We propose a new invariant for the global dynamics which in some respects has an improved behavior over the commonly used one. We illustrate its behavior in a number of numerical results. We also present a new formulation of the dynamics via catastrophe theory. We find that the change from one era to the next corresponds to a fold catastrophe, during the Kasner shifts the potential is an implicit function form whereas, as the anisotropy dissipates, the mixmaster potential must become a Morse 0-saddle. We compare and contrast our results to many known works on the mixmaster problem and indicate how extensions could be achieved. Further exploitation of this formulation may lead to a clearer understanding of the global mixmaster dynamics.",

It is tested on alanine dipeptide (AD) with four minima and eight transition states and applied to a flexible molecule, isobutyryl--(ala)3--NH--methyl (IAN), the shortest peptide which can form a full helical turn. There were found 138 minima and 490 transition states for IAN. It is shown that the connectivity network between the minima is very dilute and composed of transitions localized on one or two neighboring amide units. Most of the transitions involve one or two dihedral flips. The reaction coordinate from an extended chain conformation to a helix follows a sequence of nonoverlapping rotations around bonds. The rotations along the reaction coordinates are such that the hard repulsions between different atoms are minimized but at the same time the hydrogen bonding and the electrostatic interactions are maximized. A melting‐like transition which is associated with the sudden opening of a large number of hopping channels is identified between minima at approximately 5 kcal/mol above the lowest energy minimum. The calculated minima and transition states are used to construct a master equation for the two molecules. The vibrational spectrum of the N--H stretch as a function of time and temperature is finally calculated. It is demonstrated that time‐dependent lineshape analysis can be a useful tool to investigate the properties of the large number of minima and the intervening transitions. ",

	abstract = " The mechanical response of networks, gels, and brush layers is a manifestation of the elastic properties of the individual macromolecules. Furthermore, the elastic response of macromolecules to an applied force is the foundation of the single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques. The two main classes of models describing chain elasticity include the worm-like and freely jointed chain models. The selection between these two classes of models is based on the assumptions about chain flexibility. In many experimental situations, the choice is not clear, and a model describing the crossover between these two limiting classes is therefore in high demand. We are proposing a unified chain deformation model that describes the force−deformation curve in terms of the chain bending constant, K, and bond length, b. This model demonstrates that the worm-like and freely jointed chain models correspond to two different regimes of polymer deformation, and the crossover between these two regimes depends on the chain bending rigidity and the magnitude of the applied force. Polymer chains with bending constant K > 1 behave as a worm-like chain under tension in the interval of the applied forces f ≤ KkBT/b and as a freely jointed chain for f ≥ KkBT/b. (kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.) The proposed crossover expression for chain deformation is in excellent agreement with the results of the molecular dynamics simulations of chain deformation and single-molecule deformation experiments of biological and synthetic macromolecules.

	abstract = " The dynamics of hydrated proteins and of protein crystals can be studied within a wide temperature range, since the water of hydration does not crystallize at low temperature. Instead it turns into an amorphous glassy state below 200 K. Extending the temperature range facilitates the spectral separation of different molecular processes. The conformational motions of proteins show an abrupt enhancement near 180 K, which has been called a {\grqq}dynamical transition”. In this contribution various aspects of the transition are critically reviewed: the role of the instrumental resolution function in extracting displacements from neutron elastic scattering data and the question of the appropriate dynamic model, discrete transitions between states of different energy versus continuous diffusion inside a harmonic well, are discussed. A decomposition of the transition involving two motional components is performed: rotational transitions of methyl groups and small scale librations of side-chains, induced by water at the protein surface. Both processes create an enhancement of the observed amplitude. The onset occurs, when their time scale becomes compatible with the resolution of the spectrometer. The reorientational rate of hydration water follows a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, a characteristic feature of a dynamical transition. It occurs only with hydrated proteins, while the torsional motion of methyl groups takes place also in the dehydrated or solvent-vitrified system. Finally, the role of fast hydrogen bond fluctuations contributing to the amplitude enhancement is discussed. "

At the bottom of the other funnel is the second lowest energy minimum which is an incomplete Mackay icosahedron. We characterize the energy landscape in two ways. First, from a large sample of minima and transition states we construct a disconnectivity graph showing which minima are connected below certain energy thresholds. Second, we compute the free energy as a function of a bond-order parameter. The free energy profile has two minima, one which corresponds to the fcc funnel and the other which at low temperature corresponds to the icosahedral funnel and at higher temperatures to the liquidlike state. These two approaches show that the greater width of the icosahedral funnel, and the greater structural similarity between the icosahedral structures and those associated with the liquidlike state, are the cause of the smaller free energy barrier for entering the icosahedral funnel from the liquidlike state and therefore of the cluster’s preferential entry into this funnel on relaxation down the energy landscape. Furthermore, the large free energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral funnels, which is energetic in origin, causes the cluster to be trapped in one of the funnels at low temperature. These results explain in detail the link between the double-funnel energy landscape and the difficulty of global optimization for this cluster. ",

The examples we consider are a two-dimensional model energy surface and binary Lennard-Jones liquids and solids. A shortcoming of the mapping is its failure to divide the potential energy surface into basins of attraction surrounding saddle points, because there are many minima of ∣∇E∣2 that do not correspond to stationary points of the potential energy. In fact, most liquid configurations are mapped to such points for the system we consider. We therefore develop an alternative route to investigate higher-index saddle points and obtain near complete distributions of saddles for small Lennard-Jones clusters. The distribution of the number of stationary points as a function of the index is found to be Gaussian, and the average energy increases linearly with saddle point index in agreement with previous results for bulk systems ",

Relaxation to the global minimum is easiest for PES’s consisting of a single funnel (a set of convergent pathways which lead to the global minimum) with low barriers and a significant potential energy gradient towards the global minimum. The presence of additional funnels on the surface can severely reduce the rate of relaxation to the global minimum. Such secondary funnels act most efficiently as kinetic traps when they terminate at a low energy minimum, have a steep potential energy gradient and are wide (i.e., have a large configurational entropy) compared to the primary funnel. Indeed, it is even possible to construct PES's for which the system relaxes to the minimum at the bottom of a secondary funnel rather than the global minimum and then remains in this metastable state over a long time scale. Our results for these model PES’s are discussed in the context of theoretical and experimental knowledge of the dynamics of proteins, clusters, and glasses. ",

	abstract = " The early description of the living cell as a reaction vessel of molecules undergoing random collisions has evolved to a much more interesting picture of a small chemical factory of complex and dynamic molecular structures that carry out specialized functions in a highly-coordinated fashion. Traditional solution biochemistry has had extraordinary success in elucidating molecular structures of the cellular components. The task of capturing the dynamics and the distribution of states of these structures, however, seemed nearly impossible because the activities of the molecules in the solution are asynchronous as the result of their interactions with the surroundings. This situation has changed with the development of single-molecule biophysical methods (1, 2) that permit measurements of the response of macromolecules or individual molecular bonds to external load with the spectacular resolution of subnanometer distances and picoNewton forces, revealing details that are typically lost to ensemble averaging when studied by solution methods. Unprecedented information about the mechanisms that drive biological processes becomes encoded in the resulting wealth of unaveraged data. Recall, however, that these systems are of microscopic dimensions, which puts thermal fluctuations on equal footing with the external deterministic forces. This circumstance, along with the far from equilibrium conditions, makes a quantitative description of the molecular bond properties that can account for observed data a challenging task. The article by Freund in this issue of PNAS (3) offers a theoretical framework that does just that. A novel and concise derivation takes the reader from a very fundamental starting point to a set of analytical results that provide intriguing insights into the response of a molecular bond to an imposed mechanical load.

To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force.",

The energy landscape is mapped out using an implicit solvent model, and molecular dynamics simulations are run with the solvent explicitly modeled. Stretching a protein is shown to produce a dynamic energy landscape in which the energy minima move in configuration space, change in depth, and are created and destroyed. The connections of these landscape changes to the mechanical unfolding of the Immunoglobulin 27 domain are addressed. Hydrogen bonds break upon stretching by either intrabasin processes associated with the movement of energy minima, or interbasin processes associated with transitions between energy minima. Intrabasin changes are reversible and dominate for flexible interactions, whereas interbasin changes are irreversible and dominate for stiff interactions. The most flexible interactions are Glu-Lys salt bridges, which can act like tethers to bind strands even after all backbone interactions between the strands have been broken. As the protein is stretched, different types of structures become the lowest energy structures, including structures that incorporate nonnative hydrogen bonds. Structures that have flat energy versus elongation profiles become the lowest energy structures at elongations of several Angstroms, and are associated with the unfolding intermediate state observed experimentally.",

This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of such a transition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive account of the reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous relevance and summarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving it. We also provide an introduction to the particular structure of these biological heteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the assumptions behind this (commonly implicit) definition.

A proposed mechanism for stretching titin, by sequential denaturation of individual fibronectin type III-immunoglobulin domains in response to applied tension, is analyzed here quantitatively. The folded domain is approximately 4 nm long, and the unraveled polypeptide can extend to 29 nm, providing a 7-fold stretch over the relaxed length. Elastic recoil is achieved by refolding of the denatured domains when the force is released. The critical force required to denature a domain is calculated to be 3.5-5 pN, based on a net free energy for denaturation of 7-14 kcal/mol, plus 5 kcal/mol to extend the polypeptide (1 cal = 4.184 J). This force is comparable to the 2- to 7-pN force generated by single myosin or kinesin molecules. The force needed to pull apart a noncovalent protein-protein interface is estimated here to be 10-30 pN, implying that titin will stretch internally before the molecule is pulled from its attachment at the Z band. Many extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules, such as fibronectin, contain tandem arrays of fibronectin type III domains. Both single molecules and matrix fibers should have elastic properties similar to titin "

	abstract = "A simple micromechanical method has been developed to measure the rupture strength of a molecular-point attachment (focal bond) between two macroscopically smooth membrane capsules. In the procedure, one capsule is prepared with a low density coverage of adhesion molecules, formed as a stiff sphere, and held at fixed position by a micropipette. The second capsule without adhesion molecules is pressurized into a spherical shape with low suction by another pipette. This capsule is maneuvered to initiate point contact at the pole opposite the stiff capsule which leads to formation of a few (or even one) molecular attachments. Then, the deformable capsule is slowly withdrawn by displacement of the pipette. Analysis shows that the end-to-end extension of the capsule provides a direct measure of the force at the point contact and, therefore, the rupture strength when detachment occurs. The range for point forces accessible to this technique depends on the elastic moduli of the membrane, membrane tension, and the size of the capsule. For biological and synthetic vesicle membranes, the range of force lies between 10(-7)-10(-5) dyn (10(-12)-10(-10) N) which is 100-fold less than presently measurable by Atomic Force Microscopy! Here, the approach was used to study the forces required to rupture microscopic attachments between red blood cells formed by a monoclonal antibody to red cell membrane glycophorin, anti-A serum, and a lectin from the snail-helix pomatia. Failure of the attachments appeared to be a stochastic function of the magnitude and duration of the detachment force. We have correlated the statistical behavior observed for rupture with a random process model for failure of small numbers of molecular attachments. The surprising outcome of the measurements and analysis was that the forces deduced for short-time failure of 1-2 molecular attachments were nearly the same for all of the agglutinin, i.e., 1-2 x 10(-6) dyn. Hence, microfluorometric tests were carried out to determine if labeled agglutinins and/or labeled surface molecules were transferred between surfaces after separation of large areas of adhesive contact. The results showed that the attachments failed because receptors were extracted from the membrane.",

Multiplied by the loading rate, the breakage time specifies the force for most frequent failure (called bond strength) that obeys the same dependence on loading rate. The spectrum of bond strength versus log(loading rate) provides an image of the energy landscape traversed in the course of unbonding. However, when a weak bond is connected to very compliant elements like long polymers, the load applied to the bond does not rise steadily under constant pulling speed. Because of nonsteady loading, the most frequent breakage force can differ significantly from that of a bond loaded at constant rate through stiff linkages. Using generic models for wormlike and freely jointed chains, we have analyzed the kinetic process of failure for a bond loaded by pulling the polymer linkages at constant speed. We find that when linked by either type of polymer chain, a bond is likely to fail at lower force under steady separation than through stiff linkages. Quite unexpectedly, a discontinuous jump can occur in bond strength at slow separation speed in the case of long polymer linkages. We demonstrate that the predictions of strength versus log(loading rate) can rationalize conflicting results obtained recently for unfolding Ig domains along muscle titin with different force techniques.",

	abstract = " In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics) simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation. Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength, molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast scale of molecular motions. Using results from a simulation of biotin-avidin bonds (Izrailev, S., S. Stepaniants, M. Balsera, Y. Oono, and K. Schulten. 1997. Molecular dynamics study of unbinding of the avidin-biotin complex. Biophys. J., this issue), we describe how Brownian dynamics can help bridge the gap between molecular dynamics and probe tests. ",

This provides an explanation of the law of rectilinear diameters of Cailletet and Mathias. The theory of reaction rates yields an equation for absolute viscosity applicable to cases involving activation energies where the usual theory of energy transfer does not apply. This equation reduces to a number of the successful empirical equations under the appropriate limiting conditions. The increase of viscosity with shearing stress is explained. The same theory yields an equation for the diffusion coefficient which when combined with the viscosity and applied to the results of Orr and Butler for the diffusion of heavy into light water gives a satisfactory and suggestive interpretation. The usual theories for diffusion coefficients and absolute electrical conductance should be replaced by those developed here when ion and solvent molecule are of about the same size "

The purpose of this paper is to elucidate this problem and to estimate the rate of folding to the most stable structure near the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between this structure and the coil.Results Folding is rapid when it occurs in the vicinity of a thermodynamic [`]all-or-none' transition from the coil to the lowest-energy fold: here the misfolded and semifolded states cannot [`]trap' the folding chain since, even taken together, all these states are less stable than both the initial coil and the final stable fold of the chain. A stable globular structure can be rapidly achieved via a [`]nucleation-and-growth' folding pathway that provides a continuous entropy-by-energy compensation along the folding pathway and thus provides a low free energy of the transition state.Conclusion At the point of transition of the coil to the lowest-energy fold, an N-residue chain folds normally in ~exp(N2/3) ns. Therefore, a 100-residue chain finds its most stable fold within minutes rather than in 10100 ps [approximate] 1080 years, according to the famous paradoxical estimate of Levinthal.",

This signal reflects the dynamics in the underlying multisubstate on-off kinetic scheme (KS) of the process. The determination of the underlying KS is difficult and sometimes even impossible because of the loss of information in the mapping of the multidimensional KS onto two dimensions. Here we introduce a previously undescribed procedure that efficiently and optimally relates the signal to all equivalent underlying KS. This procedure partitions the space of KS into canonical (unique) forms that can handle any KS and obtains the topology and other details of the canonical form from the data without the need for fitting. Also established are relationships between the data and the topology of the canonical form to the on-off connectivity of a KS. The suggested canonical forms constitute a powerful tool in discriminating between KS. Based on our approach, the upper bound on the information content in two-state trajectories is determined.},

The main conclusions derived from this model are the following: (a) There are two characteristic times for the chain motion: One of them (Td) is the equilibration time for the defect concentration, and is proportional to M2. The other time (Tr) is the time required for complete renewal of the chain conformation, and is proportional to M3. (b) The over‐all mobility and diffusion coefficients of the chain P are proportional to M−2. (c) At times t < Tr the mean square displacement of one monomer of P increases only like 〈(rt − r0)2〉 = constt1/4. These results may also turn out to be useful for the (more difficult) problem of entanglement effects in unlinked molten polymers. ",

The main observable in such experiments is the distribution of the forces, at which the escape events occur. The challenge in interpreting the experimental data is to relate them to the microscopic system properties. We work out a maximum likelihood approach and show that it is the optimal method to tackle this problem. When fitting actual experimental data it is unavoidable to assume some functional form for the force-dependent escape rate. Focusing on escape processes over a single activation barrier, we consider a quite general and common such functional form and demonstrate by means of data from a realistic computer experiment that the maximum number of fit parameters that can be determined reliably is three. They are related to the force-free escape rate and the position and height of the activation barrier. Furthermore, the results for the first two of these fit parameters show little dependence on the assumption about the manner in which the barrier decreases with the applied force, while the last one, the barrier height in the absence of force, depends strongly on this assumption.",

In the author's view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropy theory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in {\grqq}viscous” liquids (shear relaxation time ≥10−9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.

(1997) Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 2690-2693]. The Jarzynski equality provides a powerful free-energy difference estimator from a set of N irreversible experiments and is closely related to free-energy perturbation, a common computational technique for estimating free-energy differences. Despite the many applications of the Jarzynski estimator, its behavior is only poorly understood. In this article we derive the large N limit for the Jarzynski estimator bias, variance, and mean square error that is correct for arbitrary perturbations. We then analyze the properties of the Jarzynski estimator for all N when the probability distribution of work values is Gaussian, as occurs, for example, in the near-equilibrium regime. This allows us to quantitatively compare it to two other free-energy difference estimators: the mean work estimator and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem estimator. We show that, for near-equilibrium switching, the Jarzynski estimator is always superior to the mean work estimator and is even superior to the fluctuation-dissipation estimator for small N. The Jarzynski-estimator bias is shown to be the dominant source of error in many cases. Our expression for the bias is used to develop a bias-corrected Jarzynski free-energy difference estimator in the near-equilibrium regime.",

We have used coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate how the unfolding mechanism of protein G varies with the magnitude and direction of applied pulling forces. We find that pulling along mechanically {\grqq}strong” coordinates gives rise to a sudden and discrete transition in unfolding mechanism, while pulling along mechanically weak coordinates induces more subtle and continuous shifts in the unfolding mechanism. We present a method of analysing these shifts in mechanism by statistical clustering of trajectories based on the order in which individual contacts dissociate during unfolding. Projection onto the fraction of native contacts and the pulling coordinate provides another means of studying shifts in unfolding mechanism and facilitates the identification of intrinsic and mechanical transition states.

Our modification of the standard GA method involves a coarse local minimization of each member of the population at every generation, as well as including the gradient into the fitness function. For Lennard-Jones (Ar)(n) clusters with n<30, the DS-GA converges far more quickly to the global minimum than either conventional GA methods or random search procedures. An application of this DS-GA is made to heterogeneous clusters of B(P-2) with multiple Ar atoms. The interaction potential is given by the lowest state of a 3X3 electronic Hamiltonian. The Ar-Ar potential and the lower energy (IT state) B-Ar potential are very similar. In contrast, the higher energy (Sigma state) B-Ar interaction is essentially repulsive. Consequently, the B atom is nearly always found to substitute for one of the atoms in the corresponding (Ar)(n+1) cluster with the fewest number of nearest neighbors.

We describe a model of the action of chaperone molecules in protein folding in vivo on the basis of a repetitive cycle of binding and unbinding, allowing the possibility of kinetic proofreading. We also study models in which chaperone binding is locally biased, depending on the similarity of the conformation to the native one. We show that while kinetic proofreading can modestly facilitate folding, it is insufficient by itself to overcome the Levinthal paradox. On the other hand, such kinetic proofreading with biasing can provide the nonequilibrium analog of a folding funnel and greatly enhance folding yields and speed up folding.}",

We use a three-letter minimal off-lattice representation of a de novo designed four-helix bundle protein. The native state of the model, which can be thought of as an alpha-carbon representation of the peptide chain, is a caricature of the sequence designed by Ho and Degrado and shows several characteristics found in the naturally occurring four-helix bundles. These include the structural aspects and the relative stability of the native conformation. The model four-helix bundle shows two characteristic temperatures T theta and Tf. The former is the temperature above which the structure resembles that of the random coil. Below the first-order folding transition temperature Tf the chain adopts the native conformation corresponding to the four-helix bundle. It is shown that in order to obtain a unique native structure a proper free energy balance between secondary and tertiary interactions is needed. The thermal denaturation starting from the unique native conformation indicates that at least a three-state analysis is required. The intermediates in the equilibrium thermal denaturation are all found to be native-like. The kinetics of refolding starting from an ensemble of denatured states shows that the acquisition of the native conformation takes place via a kinetic partitioning mechanism. A fraction of molecules, phi, reaches the native state by a topology inducing nucleation collapse mechanism, while the remainder (1-phi) follows a complex three-stage multipathway process. We suggest, in accord with our earlier studies, that phi is essentially determined by the intrinsic temperature scales T theta and Tf. Our studies indicate that better design of proteins can be achieved by making T theta as close to Tf as possible. Experimental implications for de novo design of proteins are briefly discussed.",

	abstract = "The kinetics and thermodynamics ofprotein folding is investigated using low friction Langevin simulation ofminimal continuum models ofproteins. We show that the model protein has two characteristic temperatures: (a) T\_theta, at which the chain undergoes a collapse transition from an extended conformation; (6) T\_f (< T\_theta), at which a finite size first-order transition to the folded state takes place. The kinetics of approach to the native state from initially denatured conformations is probed by several novel correlation functions. We find that the overall kinetics of approach to the native conformation occurs via a three-stage multiple pathway mechanism. The initial stage, characterized by a series of local dihedral angle transitions, eventually results in the compaction ofthe protein. Subsequently, the molecule acquires native-like structures during the second stage offolding. The final stage offolding involves activated transitions from one of the native-like structures to the native conformation. Thefirst two stages are characterized by a multiplicity of pathways while relatively few paths are involved in the final stage. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of individual trajectories reveals a novel picture of protein folding. We ind that a fraction ofthe initial population reaches the native conformation without the formation of any detectable intermediates. This pathway is associated with a nucleation mechanism, i.e., once a critical number oftertiary contacts are established then the native state is reached rapidly. The remainingfraction of molecules become trapped in misfolded structures (stabilized by incorrect tertiary contacts). The slow folding involves transitions over barriers from these structures to the native conformation. The theoretical predictions are compared with recent experiments that probe protein folding kinetics by hydrogen exchange labeling technique.",

Thermodynamic analysis shows that the increase in speed is matched by an increase in stability: the evolved sequences are much more stable in their native conformation than the initial random sequence. The unfolding temperature for evolved sequences is slightly higher than the simulation temperature, bearing direct correspondence to the relatively low stability of real proteins.",

Effective sampling of the protein conformations over the folding transition is achieved by an entropy sampling procedure, combined with a stochastically biased conformation-generating scheme and a jump-walking algorithm. Comparative analyses are carried out for optimally designed sequences and randomly selected sequences in terms of four properties: (a) the thermal folding/unfolding transitions of the different sequences; (b) the distributions of conformational populations at the corresponding transition temperatures of the sequences; (c) the fitting of the simulation results to an analytical theory; and (d) the distributions of local energy minima and the energy barriers between them in different conformational regions. It is found that all the polypeptides studied here exhibit rather sharp transitions at their folding temperatures. However, the designed/optimized sequences exhibit long-range cooperative behavior in the folding transition, while the random sequences reflect only short-range (i.e., nearest-neighbor) cooperative phenomena. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimized sequences fold to unique lowest-energy structures, but that the random sequences, when cooled, fold to compact but in general random structures. This study demonstrates that whether or not a polypeptide folds to the lowest-energy structure can be determined from its sequence by statistical mechanical characteristics. The implication of biological evolution in determining protein sequences is discussed.}",

For each state of the system, characterized by a local minimum on the potential energy surface, multiple searches for saddle points are carried out using random initial directions. The dimer method is used for the saddle point searches and the rate for each transition mechanism is estimated using harmonic transition state theory. Transitions are selected and the clock advanced according to the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. Unlike traditional applications of kinetic Monte Carlo, the atoms are not assumed to sit on lattice sites and a list of all possible transitions need not be specified beforehand. Rather, the relevant transitions are found on the fly during the simulation. A multiple time scale simulation of Al(100) crystal growth is presented where the deposition event, occurring on the time scale of picoseconds, is simulated by ordinary classical dynamics, but the time interval in between deposition events, on the order of milliseconds, is simulated by the long time scale algorithm. The Al(100) surface is found to grow remarkably smooth, even at 30 K because of concerted displacements of multiple atoms with significantly lower activation energy than adatom diffusion on the flat terrace.

While for simple mean field systems both the linear protocol and the oscillatory protocol provide reliable estimates of the free energy landscape, for a simple model of a homopolymer the oscillatory protocol turns out to be not reliable for this purpose. We then discuss the possibility of application of the method presented here to evaluate the free energy landscapes of real systems, and the practical limitations that one can face in the realization of an experimental set-up.",

The applied forces are sufficiently large to reduce the overall binding energy enough to yield unbinding within the measurement time. Our study complements earlier work on biotin-streptavidin that employed a much larger harmonic force constant. The simulations reveal a variety of unbinding pathways, the role of key residues contributing to adhesion as well as the spatial range over which avidin binds biotin. In contrast to the previous studies, the calculated rupture forces exceed by far those observed. We demonstrate, in the framework of models expressed in terms of one-dimensional Langevin equations with a schematic binding potential, the associated Smoluchowski equations, and the theory of first passage times, that picosecond to nanosecond simulation of ligand unbinding requires such strong forces that the resulting protein-ligand motion proceeds far from the thermally activated regime of millisecond AFM experiments, and that simulated unbinding cannot be readily extrapolated to the experimentally observed rupture.",

Measurements of the force required to stretch a single molecule revealed that titin behaves as a highly nonlinear entropic spring. The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at ∼2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain’s bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force versus extension curve of muscle fibers."

The results show that under strongly native conditions lysozyme can refold on parallel pathways. The major part of the lysozyme molecules (86\%) refold on a slow kinetic pathway with well-populated partially folded states. Additionally, 14\% of the molecules fold faster. The rate constant of formation of native molecules on the fast pathway corresponds well to the rate constant expected for folding to occur by a two-state process without any detectable intermediates. The results suggest that formation of the native state for the major fraction of lysozyme molecules is retarded compared with the direct folding process.

The density of states shows distinct lobes for compact and extended states, and entropic barriers for the collapse and local ordering transitions. A two-dimensional scatterplot or density of states clearly shows the multifunnel structure of the energy landscape. The anharmonic vibrational free energy is found to play a crucial role in protein folding. The problem of determining the folding transition in a multifunnel system is discussed, and novel indicators of folding are introduced.

Here, the performance of STMD is examined in the Lennard-Jones fluid with diverse simulation conditions, and in the coarse-grained, off-lattice BLN 46-mer and 69-mer protein models, exhibiting rugged potential energy landscapes with a high degree of frustration. STMD simulations combined with inherent structure (IS) analysis allow an accurate determination of protein thermodynamics down to very low temperatures, overcoming quasiergodicity, and illuminate the transitions occurring in folding in terms of the energy landscape. It is found that a thermodynamic signature of folding is significantly suppressed by accurate sampling, due to an incoherent contribution from low-lying non-native IS in multifunneled landscapes. It is also shown that preferred accessibility to such IS during the collapse transition is intimately related to misfolding or poor foldability ",

In contrast, phase diagrams in the force-temperature (f,T) plane and steered Langevin dynamics studies of these sequences, which differ in the native registry of the strands, show that S1 unfolds in an allor-none fashion, whereas unfolding of S2 occurs via an obligatory intermediate. Force-induced unfolding is determined by the native topology. After proving that the simulation results for S1 and S2 can be calculated by using native topology alone, we predict the order of unfolding events in Ig domain (Ig27) and two fibronectin III type domains (9FnIII and 10FnIII). The calculated unfolding pathways for these proteins, the location of the transition states, and the pulling speed dependence of the unfolding forces reflect the differences in the way the strands are arranged in the native states. We also predict the mechanisms of force-induced unfolding of the coiled-coil spectrin (a three-helix bundle protein) for all 20 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Our approach suggests a natural way to measure the phase diagram in the (f,C) plane, where C is the concentration of denaturants.",

In this method, the potential energy surface of the system, which contains a large number of minima, is deformed (the deformation parameter being analogous to ``time{''}) in such a way that the number of minima is decreased dramatically. The deformation is carried out by finding a solution F of the diffusion equation for some time t, with the original potential function f as the boundary condition. In the present calculations, the atoms are assumed to interact by means of a Lennard-Jones potential, with parameters pertaining to argon; however, the results can easily be rescaled to any other Lennard-Jones parameters. The Lennard-Jones potential was fitted by a linear combination of Gaussians, so chosen to reproduce the potential accurately at physically relevant distances in clusters. The choice of Gaussians as fitting functions allowed F to be determined analytically. Further, by enforcing certain constraints on the Gaussian approximation of f, the following desirable behavior of F was guaranteed: at sufficiently large (known) time, the interaction potential is purely attractive so that the minimum of F can easily be recognized as the only existing one; it corresponds to a collapsed configuration (i.e., one with all atoms occupying the same position in space). Subsequent local minimizations for gradually decreasing times (the so-called time-reversing procedure) led rapidly to the global minimum of the original function. The resulting cluster configuration did not depend on the number of reversing time steps when this number was sufficiently large (approximately 100). The method was applied to several systems of up to m = 55 atoms and successfully found the global minimum, even in the largest of these (the 55-atom system, which involves minimization in the space of dimension 3m - 6 = 159 for a function having about 10(45) local minima).}",

The complete complementary DNA sequence of human cardiac titin was determined. The 82-kilobase complementary DNA predicts a 3-megadalton protein composed of 244 copies of immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains. The architecture of sequences in the A band region of titin suggests why thick filament structure is conserved among vertebrates. In the I band region, comparison of titin sequences from muscles of different passive tension identifies two elements that correlate with tissue stiffness. This suggests that titin may act as two springs in series. The differential expression of the springs provides a molecular explanation for the diversity of sarcomere length and resting tension in vertebrate striated muscles.",

Applied force is shown to cause fold catastrophes, where free-energy minima are destabilized until they disappear. It is well-known that a fold catastrophe at force f = B implies the scaling ΔGb ≈ |B − f|3/2 in the limit of ΔGb → 0, but it is not clear whether this scaling is accurate for physically relevant barrier heights. The simulation results show that the fold catastrophe scaling is in fact accurate in the physically relevant regime and that the two-parameter function ΔGb = A(B − f)3/2 is superior to the two-parameter linear function for parametrizing changes in free-energy barriers with applied force.

We employ an iterative, consensus-based scheme to cluster the 725 nonbonded distances between the hydrophobic beads using, in tandem, Ward’s method for hierarchical clustering and k-means partitional clustering. We also independently analyze the same data using computer-automated histogram filtering, a technology designed to cluster high-dimensional data, without the tedium and subjectivity required by our iterative implementation of the two classical clustering methods. The memberships of low-energy clusters obtained from both classical clustering and automated histogram filtering approaches are remarkably similar. Nonbonded distance constraints are derived from these clusters and from small sets of the original unclustered conformations obtained by simulated annealing. Employing a distance geometry approach, we efficiently generate novel, low-energy conformations from each set of distance constraints, including the apparent native structure, up to 40 times faster than by doing additional simulated annealing runs. Over 33 000 unique locally optimized conformations are generated in total, substantially augmenting the number of low-energy states located by the original simulated annealing runs. ",

Although Monte Carlo simulations provide insights into the long-time processes involved in protein folding, these simulations cannot systematically chart the conformational energy surface that enables folding. By assuming that protein folding occurs after chain collapse, a kinetic map of important pathways on this surface is constructed through the use of an analytical theory of probability flow. Convergent kinetic pathways, or "folding funnels," guide folding to a unique, stable, native conformation. Solution of the probability flow equations is facilitated by limiting treatment to diffusion between geometrically similar collapsed conformers. Similarity is measured in terms of a reconfigurational distance. Two specific amino acid sequences are deemed foldable and nonfoldable because one gives rise to a single, large folding funnel leading to a native conformation and the other has multiple pathways leading to several stable conformers. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that folding funnel calculations accurately predict the fact of and the pathways involved in folding-specific sequences. The existence of folding funnels for specific sequences suggests that geometrically related families of stable, collapsed conformers fulfill kinetic and thermodynamic requirements of protein folding.},

Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 8730] that the {\grqq}clamp” formed by the parallel strands in this domain represents an optimal topology maximizing the mechanical strength of cross-linked polymer chains. Here we use simulations to demonstrate that protein G IgG-binding domain III and ubiquitin, both exhibiting a parallel strand arrangement similar to that in I27 but otherwise having a distinctly different fold and not involved in an obvious load-bearing function, exhibit high resistance to mechanical unfolding. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we compute the potential of mean force as a function of the distance between the domains' C- and N-termini and use transition state theory to calculate the force-dependent rates of unfolding. We further predict the outcome of a hypothetical single-molecule AFM pulling experiment, in which one of the I27 domains in titin is replaced by one of the above two proteins. For typical AFM pulling rates, the predicted unfolding force is in the range 190−220 pN for ubiquitin and 100−150 pN for the IgG-binding domain. ",

We test Jarzynski's equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the DeltaG profile of the stretching process to within k(B)T/2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching.

Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.",

	abstract = " Steered molecular dynamics simulation of force-induced titin immunoglobulin domain I27 unfolding led to the discovery of a significant potential energy barrier at an extension of ∼14{\AA} on the unfolding pathway that protects the domain against stretching. Previous simulations showed that this barrier is due to the concurrent breaking of six interstrand hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between β-strands A′ and G that is preceded by the breaking of two to three hydrogen bonds between strands A and B, the latter leading to an unfolding intermediate. The simulation results are supported by {\AA}ngstrom-resolution atomic force microscopy data. Here we perform a structural and energetic analysis of the H-bonds breaking. It is confirmed that H-bonds between strands A and B break rapidly. However, the breaking of the H-bond between strands A′ and G needs to be assisted by fluctuations of water molecules. In nanosecond simulations, water molecules are found to repeatedly interact with the protein backbone atoms, weakening individual interstrand H-bonds until all six A′--G H-bonds break simultaneously under the influence of external stretching forces. Only when those bonds are broken can the generic unfolding take place, which involves hydrophobic interactions of the protein core and exerts weaker resistance against stretching than the key event.

The simulations on different domains for 0.6 nanosecond each reveal two types of protein responses: the first type, arising in certain β-sandwich domains, exhibits nanosecond unfolding only after a force above 1,500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a wider class of protein domain structures, requires significantly weaker forces for nanosecond unfolding. In the first case, strong forces are needed to concertedly break a set of interstrand hydrogen bonds which protect the domains against unfolding through stretching; in the second case, stretching breaks backbone hydrogen bonds one by one, and does not require strong forces for this purpose.

The behavior of titin as a multistage entropic spring has been shown in atomic force microscope and optical tweezer experiments to partially depend on the reversible unfolding of individual Ig domains. We performed steered molecular dynamics simulations to stretch single titin Ig domains in solution with pulling speeds of 0.5 and 1.0{\AA}/ps. Resulting force-extension profiles exhibit a single dominant peak for each Ig domain unfolding, consistent with the experimentally observed sequential, as opposed to concerted, unfolding of Ig domains under external stretching forces. This force peak can be attributed to an initial burst of backbone hydrogen bonds, which takes place between antiparallel β-strands A and B and between parallel β-strands A′ and G. Additional features of the simulations, including the position of the force peak and relative unfolding resistance of different Ig domains, can be related to experimental observations. ",

By modifying the idealized PES model to make it more and more complicated, we demonstrate a systematic method to study the complex kinetics on large PES. The idealized PES model is used to explore the feasibility and the robustness of statistical sampling of large PES. We develop several sampling strategies, such as the ``rough topography sampling'' and the ``low barrier saddle sampling'' in the idealized PES model and find they are also applicable to a realistic PES of the 13-atom Morse cluster with range parameter rho = 6.

For a wide range of forces, the unfolding dynamics can be treated as one- dimensional diffusion, parametrized in terms of the end-to-end distance. In particular, the escape times can be evaluated as first passage times for a Brownian particle moving on the protein free-energy landscape, using the Smoluchowski equation. At strong forces, the unfolding process can be viewed as a diffusive drift away from the native state, while at weak forces thermal activation is the relevant mechanism. An escape-time analysis within this approach reveals a crossover from an exponential to an inverse Gaussian escape-time distribution upon passing from weak to strong forces. Moreover, a single expression valid at weak and strong forces can be devised both for the average unfolding time as well as for the corresponding variance.

The model has a phase transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like phase. Particular interest is paid to the dependence of the nature of this phase transition on the number of degrees of freedom. As expected the transition becomes sharper as the number of degrees of freedom increases. The phase properties of the model are discussed conveniently in terms of Landau functions. In the canonical ensemble the relevant function is the Landau free energy F(Q, T), a function of the order parameter Q and the temperature T. The corresponding function in a microcanonical ensemble is minus the Landau entropy, a function of the order parameter and total energy. These functions can, in general, be calculated from probability distributions which are available from simulations. In both cases stable or metastable phases correspond to valleys in the function; continuous transitions to merging valleys and first-order phase changes to valleys separated by barriers. The N dependence of the Landau functions per degree of freedom is very weak, so that the best criterion for determining the order of a phase transition, which is valid for large and small systems, is the presence or absence of a barrier in the relevant Landau function. The limits of metastability of phases occur at the heads of the valleys in the Landau functions. It is shown that these can be related to the properties of the system in the potential ensemble. The model exhibits a region of negative specific heat (i.e., an S-band in the caloric curve) in the microcanonical ensemble which becomes vanishingly small in the limit of large N. Finally, the relation of these results to other proposed criteria for the limits of metastability of solid phases is discussed.}",

The constant energy dynamics is applied to the calculation of equilibrium thermodynamic averages for a Lennard-Jones cluster and fluid to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approximate method for the simulation of many-body condensed phase systems. The rate of kinetic energy equipartitioning is examined for GPP dynamics using a generalization of the ergodic measure and found to be significantly faster than for standard molecular dynamics simulation. A global optimization algorithm is developed based on simulated annealing of the phase space density distribution. This method is applied to the global energy minimization of Lennard-Jones clusters and found to be superior to simulated annealing methods employing classical point particles.}",

Several characteristics of the potential energy surface are monitored as the volume is changed, including normal mode frequencies, barrier heights, and orientations and distances between the local minima and transition states. These characteristics are used to elucidate the disappearance of the local minimum and the ensuing relaxation to a different local minimum. The disappearance of an energy minimum becomes more probable as the number of atoms in the system increases.

We discuss how this scaling will therefore be relevant at finite temperatures and gives corrections to Eyring’s theory for transition rates. "

	abstract = " RNA folding is a kinetic process governed by the competition of a large number of structures stabilized by the transient formation of base pairs that may induce complex folding pathways and the formation of misfolded structures. Despite its importance in modern biophysics, the current understanding of RNA folding kinetics is limited by the complex interplay between the weak base pair interactions that stabilize the native structure and the disordering effect of thermal forces. The possibility of mechanically pulling individual molecules offers a new perspective to understand the folding of nucleic acids. Here we investigate the folding and misfolding mechanism in RNA secondary structures pulled by mechanical forces. We introduce a model based on the identification of the minimal set of structures that reproduce the patterns of force-extension curves obtained in single molecule experiments. The model requires only two fitting parameters: the attempt frequency at the level of individual base pairs and a parameter associated to a free-energy correction that accounts for the configurational entropy of an exponentially large number of neglected secondary structures. We apply the model to interpret results recently obtained in pulling experiments in the three-helix junction S15 RNA molecule (RNAS15). We show that RNAS15 undergoes force-induced misfolding where force favors the formation of a stable non-native hairpin. The model reproduces the pattern of unfolding and refolding force-extension curves, the distribution of breakage forces, and the misfolding probability obtained in the experiments. ",

We start by considering the case of small single-domain RNA molecules, which unfold in a cooperative way. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimental results and allows us to investigate the influence of the bead and handles on the unfolding reaction. A main ingredient of the model is to consider the appropriate statistical ensemble and the corresponding thermodynamic potential describing thermal fluctuations in the system. We then investigate several questions relevant to extract thermodynamic information from experimental data. The kinetics of unfolding is also studied by introducing a dynamical model. Finally, we apply the model to the more general problem of a multidomain RNA molecule with Mg(2+) tertiary contacts that unfolds in a sequential way.",

The model includes different elements of the experimental setup (beads, handles, and RNA sequence) and limitations of the instrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of data acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the measured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the experiments reported in the companion article. The comparison between theory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal experimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that the longest handles and softest traps that allow detection of the folding/unfolding signal (handles approximately 5-10 Kbp and traps approximately 0.03 pN/nm) represent the best conditions to obtain the intrinsic molecular rates.

At the molecular level, we apply the method to tautomerization processes in nucleic acid bases and the double proton transfer in nucleic acid base pairs. For bulk systems, we considered the concerted exchange mechanism in Si, which is a complicated pathway for defect-free diffusion in the diamond lattice. For surface systems, we considered ad-dimer diffusion mechanisms on Si(100). We incorporated the climbing image extension of the nudged elastic band method and compared it against the original approach on two-dimensional model potential energy surfaces. Based on favorable comparisons with related methods and the general implementation of our method, we believe that this is well suited for efficient estimates of activation barriers with sophisticated electronic structure codes.

In addition to reproducing the re-entrant surfaces, the theory suggests that the total surface energy of the decahedral form is sandwiched between those of a single crystal and an icosahedral MTP. Consequently the stability of the decahedral particles (in a certain size range) relative to single crystals can now be explained. A useful perturbation modification is also outlined which enables qualitative comparisons of the surface energies to be made, and shows that the twin boundaries in MTPs limit the possible surface facets. Explicit shapes and energies are presented for two extreme models of the faceting. Finally, a model is outlined to justify the difference between the structures reported here and the more common decahedra and Icosahedra—the standard forms are artefacts of the growth process; they are not the thermodynamically most stable structures.

Previous work on the experimental elongation of single titin molecules has suggested that force causes consecutive unfolding of each domain in an all-or-none fashion. To avoid problems associated with the heterogeneity of the modular, naturally occurring titin, we engineered single proteins to have multiple copies of single immunoglobulin domains of human cardiac titin. Here we report the elongation of these molecules using the atomic force microscope. We find an abrupt extension of each domain by approximately 7 A before the first unfolding event. This fast initial extension before a full unfolding event produces a reversible 'unfolding intermediate' Steered molecular dynamics simulations show that the rupture of a pair of hydrogen bonds near the amino terminus of the protein domain causes an extension of about 6 A, which is in good agreement with our observations. Disruption of these hydrogen bonds by site-directed mutagenesis eliminates the unfolding intermediate. The unfolding intermediate extends titin domains by approximately 15\% of their slack length, and is therefore likely to be an important previously unrecognized component of titin elasticity. ",

Thus, hundreds of unzipping events can be tested in a short period of time (few minutes), independently of the unzipping voltage amplitude. Because our method does not entail the physical coupling of the molecules under test to a force transducer, very high throughput can be achieved. We used our method to study DNA unzipping kinetics at small forces, which have not been accessed before. We find that in this regime the static unzipping times decrease exponentially with voltage with a characteristic slope that is independent of the duplex region sequence, and that the intercept depends strongly on the duplex region energy. We also present the first nanopore dynamic force measurements (time varying force). Our results are in agreement with the approximately logV dependence at high V (where V is the loading rate) observed by other methods.

The global geometry of the energy landscape appears to contain relevant information on the behavior of the various sequences: in particular, the fluctuations of the curvature of the energy landscape, measured by means of numerical simulations, clearly mark the folding transition and allow the proteinlike sequences to be distinguished from the others.

The most interesting case turns out to be the regime of weak-to-medium damping, in which case the Fokker-Planck equation can be reduced to an equation or to a system of integral equations of the Wiener-Hopf type. Exact solutions can then be given for the escape rate from single- and double-well potentials. This general scheme can be naturally extended to include quantum penetration through a semiclassical barrier and the effect of quantum noise. Finally, we consider the Brownian motion in titled washboard potential using Josephson junctions as an illustrative example. In that context we calculate (i) fluctuation-induced voltage-current characteristics; (ii) the lifetime of a zero-voltage state; (iii) the lifetime of the running state; (iv) partial probabilities of the phase jumps by 2πn (n is an integer); and (v) retrapping current distribution in both the classical and quantum regimes.

But for weak noncovalent bonds, a dynamic spectrum of bond strengths is predicted as the loading rate is altered, with the measured strength being governed by the prominent barriers traversed in the energy landscape along the force-driven bond-dissociation pathway. In other words, the pioneering early AFM measurements represent only a single point in a continuous spectrum of bond strengths, because theory predicts that these will depend on the rate at which the load is applied. Here we report the strength spectra for the bonds between streptavidin (or avidin) and biotins-the prototype of receptor-ligand interactions used in earlier AFM studies, and which have been modelled by molecular dynamics. We have probed bond formation over six orders of magnitude in loading rate, and find that the bond survival time diminished from about 1 min to 0.001 s with increasing loading rate over this range. The bond strength, meanwhile, increased from about 5 pN to 170 pN. Thus, although they are among the strongest noncovalent linkages in biology (affinity of 10(13) to 10(15) M(-1)), these bonds in fact appear strong or weak depending on how fast they are loaded. We are also able to relate the activation barriers derived from our strength spectra to the shape of the energy landscape derived from simulations of the biotin-avidin complex.",

Results are obtained for comparison with the potential energy surfaces of model glass formers studied in previous work. The constant pressure condition, where the the box lengths of the simulation cell vary, makes the enthalpy surface less rugged than the potential energy surface corresponding to the same mean density. Analysis of barrier heights as a function of pressure provides insight into transport and relaxation processes. Elementary rearrangements can be separated into "diffusive" and "nondiffusive" processes, where the former involve changes in the nearest-neighbor coordination of at least one atom, and the latter do not. With increasing pressure the barrier heights for cage-breaking rearrangements rise, while those for cage-preserving rearrangements appear relatively unchanged. The {\grqq}strong” or {\grqq}fragile” character of the system can therefore change with pressure because the barriers encountered vary in a systematic fashion. The geometric mean normal mode frequencies of a binary Lennard-Jones system decrease with increasing potential energy for constant pressure, rather than increase as they do at constant volume, in agreement with a simple model. },

We perform Monte Carlo dynamics simulations on short self-avoiding copolymer chains on two-dimensional square lattices. The driving force for collapse is the aversion of nonpolar monomers for water. The chain monomers are of two types, H and P; favorable interactions occur among HH contacts. One respect in which this study differs from previous Monte Carlo folding studies is that the chains are sufficiently short that: (i) we can know unequivocally which conformations are at global minima (the ``native{''} states) and which are at local minima of free energy, (ii) we can explore ``pathway space{''} densely to determine the relative probabilities of all the possible pathways, and thus we establish that the model is ergodic and gives the equilibrium distribution in the long-time limit. We find that any individual molecule passes through a wide range of conformational states, often many times. Nevertheless, this meandering is not inconsistent with the observation that proteins fold through specific pathways involving particular sequences of events. Some pathways are strongly favored; i.e., folding is ``cooperative{''} in that a ``nucleating{''} HH contact acts as a constraint that restricts local conformational freedom and speeds the ``zipping up{''} of other contacts nearby. Which pathways are favored depends on the sequence and the solvent. How does a chain fold to its native state so quickly? For these short chains of fixed length, we observe three regimes of folding kinetics. In the ``Levinthal limit,{''} as the HH attraction approaches zero, folding is slow because the molecule searches randomly through the large ensemble of open conformations. In the ``multiple minima{''} limit, when the HH attraction is very strong, folding is also slow because the chain becomes stuck in local minima of wrong compact conformations. However, we find that folding is relatively fast for intermediate HH attraction because the driving force ``directs{''} the molecule toward a small ensemble of compact states, and yet incorrect potential wells are not too deep to slow this process.}",

We observe both apparent two-state unfolding and several unfolding pathways involving one of three major, mutually exclusive intermediate states. All three major intermediates lack two of seven native [beta]-strands, and share a quite similar extension. The unfolding behavior is found to depend strongly on the pulling conditions. In particular, we observe large variations in the relative frequencies of occurrence for the intermediates. At low constant force or low constant velocity, all three major intermediates occur with a significant frequency. At high constant force or high constant velocity, one of them, with the N- and C-terminal [beta]-strands detached, dominates over the other two. Using the extended Jarzynski equality, we also estimate the equilibrium free-energy landscape, calculated as a function of chain extension. The application of a constant pulling force leads to a free-energy profile with three major local minima. Two of these correspond to the native and fully unfolded states, respectively, whereas the third one can be associated with the major unfolding intermediates.",

First, we show how the inherent structure energy density can be obtained from the probability density determined by sampling molecular dynamics trajectories and quenching. The analysis of the inherent structure landscape can characterize the folding transition. Then we show how thermodynamics of the inherent states can be established to study the equilibrium properties of proteins. Our work brings some elements into the current discussion about the protein dynamical transition. The study uses a simplified model to illustrate the ideas, but, as the inherent structure landscape is much simpler than the free energy surface of the protein, it appears to be accessible for an all-atom model of a small protein, at the expense of much longer calculations.",

Nonequilibrium work theorems such as Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorem have been devised to recover free energy differences between states of this extended system. However, one is often more interested in the potential of mean force of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, i.e., in the effective potential dictating the equilibrium distribution of the collective coordinate in the absence of the external potential. In this respect, Hummer and Szabo proposed an algorithm to estimate the desired free energy differences when pulling experiments are performed in only one direction of the process ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 3658 ). In this paper, we present a potential of mean force estimator of the unperturbed system that exploits the work measured in both forward and backward directions of the process. The method is based on the reweighting technique of Hummer and Szabo and on the Bennett acceptance ratio. Using Brownian-dynamics simulations on a double-well free energy surface, we show that the estimator works satisfactorily in any pulling situation, from nearly equilibrium to strongly dissipative regimes. The method is also applied to the unfolding/refolding process of decaalanine, a system vastly used to illustrate and to test nonequilibrium methodologies. A thorough comparative analysis with another bidirectional potential of mean force estimator ( Minh, D. D. L.; Adib, A. B. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008, 100, 180602 ) is also presented. The proposed approach is well-suited to recover free energy profiles from single-molecule bidirectional-pulling experiments such as those performed by optical tweezers or atomic force microscopes.",

Phys. 104, 2684 (1996)] proposed a global geometry optimization technique using a modified Genetic Algorithm approach for clusters. They refer to their technique as a deterministic/stochastic genetic algorithm (DS-GA). In this technique, the stochastic part is a traditional GA, with the manipulations being carried out on binary-coded internal coordinates (atom-atom distances). The deterministic aspect of their method is the inclusion of a coarse gradient descent calculation on each geometry. This step avoids spending a large amount of computer time searching parts of the configuration space which correspond to high-energy geometries. Their tests of the technique show it is vastly more efficient than searches without this local minimization. They report geometries for clusters of up to n = 29 Ar atoms, and find that their computer time scales as O(n(4.5)). In this work, we have recast the genetic algorithm optimization in space-fixed Cartesian coordinates, which scale much more favorably than internal coordinates for large clusters. We introduce genetic operators suited for real (base-10) variables. We find convergence for clusters up to n = 55. Furthermore, our algorithm scales as O(n(3.3)). It is concluded that genetic algorithm optimization in nonseparable real variables is not only viable, but numerically superior to that in internal candidates for atomic cluster calculations. Furthermore, no special choice of variable need be made for different cluster types; real Cartesian variables are readily portable, and can be used for atomic and molecular clusters with no extra effort.

Such a landscape leads not only to fast folding and stable native conformations but, more importantly, to sequences that are robust to variations in the protein environment and to sequence mutations. In this paper, an off-lattice model of sequences that fold into a β-barrel native structure is used to describe a framework that can quantitatively distinguish good and bad folders. The two sequences analyzed have the same native structure, but one of them is minimally frustrated whereas the other one exhibits a high degree of frustration. ",

We explain the theoretical framework that underlies this method and use it to clarify the connection between the experimentally determined Φ value, a quantity determined by the ratio of rate and stability changes due to point mutations, and the average structure of the transition state ensemble. To determine the accuracy of this thermodynamic approach, we apply it to minimalist protein models and compare these results with the ones obtained by using the standard experimental procedure for determining Φ values. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends sensitively on the amount of frustration. In particular, the results are similar when applied to models with minimal amounts of frustration, characteristic of rapid-folding, single-domain globular proteins.",

The choice of different interaction energies (±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2J/kTc) sinh(2J′/kTc)=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as -log |T-Tc|. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2J/kT) tanh(2J′/kT))n. },

It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates.

This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed.

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Energy landscape theory predicts that the folding funnel for a small fast-folding alpha-helical protein will have a transition state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the position of the transition state along an appropriate reaction coordinate can be obtained from linear free energy relationships observed for folding and unfolding rate constants as a function of denaturant concentration. The experimental results of Huang and Oas for lambda repressor, Fersht and collaborators for C12, and Gray and collaborators for cytochrome c indicate a free energy barrier midway between the folded and unfolded regions. This barrier arises from an entropic bottleneck for the folding process. RESULTS: In keeping with the experimental results, lattice simulations based on the folding funnel description show that the transition state is not just a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of configurations that can be described by specific values of one or a few order parameters (e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of this transition state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations and from atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko and Brooks indicates a broad distribution for native contact participation in the transition state ensemble centered around 50\%. Importantly, however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble does include some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the experiments, which have been termed by others a folding nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Linear free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy of the transition state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction coordinate based on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck may be thought of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different native contacts will have different degrees of participation. The agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions provides strong support for the landscape analysis.",

This construct also shows increased coil aggregation during refolding, and a 14-mer peptide encompassing the engineered sequence forms fibrils. Mutational analysis shows that intermolecular association is linked to the overall hydrophobicity of the sticky sequence and implies the existence of "structural gatekeepers" in the wild-type protein, that is, charged side chains that prevent aggregation by interrupting contiguous stretches of hydrophobic residues in the primary sequence.},

Intermediates detected by comparing unfolding with a biasing perturbation and a constant pulling force are not evident in temperature-induced unfolding. For an alpha-helical domain (alpha-spectrin), which forms part of the cytoskeleton, there is little commonality in the pathways from unfolding induced by stretching and temperature.

	abstract = " Titin, an important constituent of vertebrate muscles, is a protein of the order of a micrometer in length in the folded state. Atomic force microscopy and laser tweezer experiments have been used to stretch titin molecules to more than ten times their folded lengths. To explain the observed relation between force and extension, it has been suggested that the immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains unfold one at a time in an all-or-none fashion. We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the forced unfolding of two different fibronectin type 3 domains (the ninth,9Fn3, and the tenth,10Fn3, from human fibronectin) and of their heterodimer of known structure. An external biasing potential on the N to C distance is employed and the protein is treated in the polar hydrogen representation with an implicit solvation model. The latter provides an adiabatic solvent response, which is important for the nanosecond unfolding simulation method used here. A series of simulations is performed for each system to obtain meaningful results. The two different fibronectin domains are shown to unfold in the same way along two possible pathways. These involve the partial separation of the 'beta-sandwich', an essential structural element, and the unfolding of the individual sheets in a stepwise fashion. The biasing potential results are confirmed by constant force unfolding simulations. For the two connected domains, there is complete unfolding of one domain (9Fn3) before major unfolding of the second domain (10Fn3). Comparison of different models for the potential energy function demonstrates that the dominant cohesive element in both proteins is due to the attractive van der Waals interactions; electrostatic interactions play a structural role but appear to make only a small contribution to the stabilization of the domains, in agreement with other studies of [beta]-sheet stability. The unfolding forces found in the simulations are of the order of those observed experimentally, even though the speed of the former is more than six orders of magnitude greater than that used in the latter.",

In this paper we describe a statistical-based methodology to quantify the local structural variability of a distribution of biopolymers, applied to 46- and 69-{\grqq}residue” off-lattice, three-color model proteins. Each folds into β-barrel structures. First we perform a principal component analysis of all interbead distance variables for a large number of independent, converged Boltzmann-distributed samples of conformations collected at each of a wide range of temperatures. Next, the principal component vectors are subjected to orthogonal (varimax) rotation. The results are displayed on so-called {\grqq}squared-loading” plots. These provide a quantitative measure of the contribution to the sample variance of the position of each residue relative to the others. Dominant structural elements, those having the largest structural diversity within the sampled distribution, are responsible for peaks and shoulders observed in the specific heat versus temperature curves, generated using the weighted histogram analysis method. The loading plots indicate that the local-structural diversity of these systems changes gradually with temperature through the folding transition but radically changes near the collapse transition temperature. The analysis of the structural overlap order statistic suggests that the 46-mer thermodynamic folding transition involves the native state and at least three other nearly native intermediates. In the case of the 46-mer protein model, data are generated at sufficiently low temperatures that squared-loading plots, coupled with cluster analysis, provide a local and energetic description of its glassy state.",

Even in highly evolved proteins, there is a strong random element in the sequences, which gives rise to a statistical ensemble of sequences for a given folded shape. Simple analytic models give rise to phase transitions between random, glassy, and folded states, depending on the temperature T and the design temperature Tdes of the ensemble of sequences. Besides considering the analytic results obtainable in a random-energy model and in the Flory mean-field model of polymers, the article reports on confirming numerical simulations. ",

A poorly chosen initial guess can cause slow convergence, convergence to an incorrect pathway, or even failed electronic structure force calculations along the guessed pathway. This paper presents a growing string method that can find minimum energy pathways and transition states without the requirement of an initial guess for the pathway. The growing string begins as two string fragments, one associated with the reactants and the other with the products. Each string fragment is grown separately until the fragments converge. Once the two fragments join, the full string moves toward the minimum energy pathway according to the algorithm for the string method. This paper compares the growing string method to the string method and to the nudged elastic band method using the alanine dipeptide rearrangement as an example. In this example, for which the linearly interpolated guess is far from the minimum energy pathway, the growing string method finds the saddle point with significantly fewer electronic structure force calculations than the string method or the nudged elastic band method.

In the present paper we propose the so-called shift method (also deterministic), which deforms the original potential energy hypersurface by shifting the atom-atom Lennard-Jones potential. As a result, the whole system collapses into a single point. Then, by using the reversing procedure, the original potential is gradually restored while optimizing the structure for each step. This results in a kind of big bang, because the atoms emerge from the collapse point and the cluster geometry evolves to the final one corresponding to the original undeformed potential. The procedure applied to the clusters containing up to 19 atoms turned out to produce in all cases under study the structures of the lowest energy.}",

This is because of a prohibitively large volume of the configurational space as well as of energy barriers between numerous potential energy basins. In the present paper the molecular dynamics is performed on a deformed potential energy hypersurface. The deformation is tunable, and when increased, the barriers become lower or even disappear; therefore, the system is able to explore much larger regions of the configurational space. The deformation is slowly released, and finally the molecular dynamics is continued on the undeformed potential energy hypersurface. As a result of such a procedure, some low-energy structures may be found in a more effective way. The method has been applied to the clusters of the N Lennard-Jones atoms, N = 5,..., 66, which is the most extensive systematic study of the clusters published till now. The energies of the clusters are lower than those obtained by the classical molecular dynamics (at the same numerical effort) for the starting points being far away from the lowest energy region. Contrary to the molecular dynamics, they are independent of the starting point to a significant degree. The size of the most stable cluster turned out to be a stepwise increasing function of N, which reflects building of new atomic shells. However, for N = 38 some qualitative change of the structure to the one characteristic for the infinite crystal occurs and the cluster size becomes abnormally low when compared to the clusters with N < 38 and N > 38.y}",

Here, however, we summarize recent experimental results which suggest that (1) despite a vast diversity of structures and functions, there are fundamental similarities in the folding mechanisms of single domain proteins and (2) rather than being highly sensitive to the finest details of sequence, their folding kinetics are determined primarily by the large-scale, redundant features of sequence that determine a protein's gross structural properties. That folding kinetics can be predicted using simple, empirical, structure-based rules suggests that the fundamental physics underlying folding may be quite straightforward and that a general and quantitative theory of protein folding rates and mechanisms (as opposed to unfolding rates and thus protein stability) may be near on the horizon.

Recent technological developments have provided the tools to design and build scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate and visualize individual molecules and measure microscopic forces. Using SMEs it is possible to manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions describing molecular properties, characterize the kinetics of biomolecular reactions and detect molecular intermediates. SMEs provide additional information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SMEs it is also possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a very introductory level, emphasizing the importance of SMEs to scientists interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary topics accessible by these techniques. The review discusses SMEs from an experimental perspective, first exposing the most common experimental methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where such techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOTs), magnetic tweezers (MTs), biomembrane force probes (BFPs) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I then present several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA and DNA condensation) and proteins (protein--protein interactions, protein folding and molecular motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SMEs to the study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small systems and the experimental verification of fluctuation theorems.

	abstract = " Two-state models provide phenomenological descriptions of many different systems, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. We investigate work fluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of equilibrium under the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the probability density PN(W) that work equal to W is exerted upon the system (of size N) along a given non-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory thermodynamics formalism to quantify work fluctuations in the large-N limit. We then define a trajectory entropy SN(W) that counts the number of non-equilibrium trajectories PN(W) = exp(SN(W)/kBT) with work equal to W and characterizes fluctuations of work trajectories around the most probable value Wmp. A trajectory free energy can also be defined, which has a minimum at W = W†, this being the value of the work that has to be efficiently sampled to quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this formalism a Lagrange multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays the role of a trajectory temperature. Our general solution for PN(W) exactly satisfies the fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate heat fluctuations for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The heat distribution is then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing small and frequent heat exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the statistics of large deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of the exponential tails is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature. Finite-size effects to the large-N theory and the recovery of work distributions for finite N are also discussed. Finally, we pay particular attention to the case of magnetic nanoparticle systems under the action of a magnetic field H where work and heat fluctuations are predicted to be observable in ramping experiments in micro-SQUIDs.

To first order, the amount of dissipated work is directly proportional to the rate of application of force (the loading rate) and to the relaxation time of the molecule. The model yields estimates for parameters that characterize the unfolding kinetics under force in agreement with those obtained in recent experimental results. We obtain a general equation for the minimum number of repeated experiments needed to obtain an equilibrium free energy, to within k(B)T, from nonequilibrium experiments by using the Jarzynski formula.

We term the large collection of amorphous (KCl)32 structures the ‘‘microamorphous’’ state, on the basis that they are as disordered as the bulk glass phase. Liquid (KCl)32 was quenched to investigate how fast the cooling rate must be to trap (KCl)32 in one of the high‐energy amorphous structures. Even at unrealistically fast cooling rates, (KCl)32 was able to locate its microcrystal structure. A shielded Coulomb interaction potential was used to test whether reducing the range of the pairwise potential would make it possible to prepare amorphous binary clusters. Several different values of the shielding range were tested. These results are discussed in terms of the structure of the underlying potential energy surface. A short study was conducted of the temperature dependence of the time it takes, on average, for supercooled (KCl)32 to relax into the crystalline regions of its potential energy surface. Lastly, we rationalize, in terms of the potential energy surface, the qualitative temperature dependence of the heat capacity for both the first‐order and glass transitions. ",

Nevertheless, protein sequences do fold into unique native states in seconds (the Levinthal paradox). To determine how the Levinthal parades is resolved, we use a lattice Monte Carlo model in which the global minimum (native state) is known. The necessary and sufficient condition for folding in this model is that the native state be a pronounced global minimum on the potential surface. This guarantees thermodynamic stability of the native state at a temperature where the chain does not get trapped in local minima. Folding starts by a rapid collapse from a random-coil state to a random semi-compact globule. It then proceeds by a slow, rate-determining search through the semicompact states to find a transition state from which the chain folds rapidly to the native state. The elements of the folding mechanism that lead to the resolution of the Levinthal parades are the reduced number of conformations that need to be searched in the semicompact globule (similar to 10(10) versus similar to 10(16) for the random coil) and the existence of many (similar to 10(3)) transition states. The results have evolutionary implications and suggest principles for the folding of real proteins.}",

	abstract = " Most materials attain a glassy state at low temperatures under suitable methods of preparation. This state exhibits the mechanical properties of a solid, but shows microscopic structural disorder1,2. A comprehensive understanding of the glassy state is, however, still lacking3. A widespread assumption is that the non-exponential relaxation processes observed in the dynamics of glasses — and also in protein dynamics, protein folding and population dynamics — are (in common with other manifestations of complex dynamics) strongly influenced by the underlying energy landscape associated with the structural configurations that the system may adopt. But concrete evidence for this in studies of glass formation has been scarce. Here we present such evidence, obtained from computer simulations of a model glass-forming liquid. We demonstrate that the onset of non-exponential relaxation corresponds to a well defined temperature below which the depth of the potential-energy minima explored by the liquid increases with decreasing temperature, and above which it does not. At lower temperatures, we observe a sharp transition when the liquid gets trapped in the deepest accessible energy basin. This transition temperature depends on the cooling rate, in a manner analogous to the experimental glass transition. We also present evidence that the barrier heights separating potential-energy minima sampled by the liquid increase abruptly at a temperature above the glass transition but well below the onset of non-exponential relaxation. This identification of a relationship between static, topographic features of the energy landscape and complex dynamics holds the promise of a clearer, possibly thermodynamic, understanding of the glass transition.

The energies of the conformational states of the protein are taken to be random variables. The degree of similarity of each state with the native is described by an order parameter ρ. The energy is, on average, a decreasing function of ρ, in line with the principle of minimal frustration. The limiting case model described here has global connectivity. There are no restrictions on the change in order parameter in the elementary moves through conformational space. The folding kinetics vary as a function of both the energy gap between the folded and unfolded states and the roughness of the energy landscape. This model yields curved Arrhenius plots that are qualitatively similar to those seen in experiments and in simulations of protein folding. We show that in globally connected models, the Laplace transformed concentrations of species obey a frequency dependent generalization of the law of mass action. We show that when states with intermediate degrees of ordering are included in a globally connected model, one obtains much the same qualitative behavior as some experiments that are often used to justify the existence of specific intermediates along a sequential pathway even though there is no such path in the model. Also we show that for short times, populations of ensembles of configurations are dominated by entropic considerations: an observation in harmony with studies on initial events in folding based on more detailed models. Thus, we believe that this model sheds light on the interpretation of experiments that probe protein folding kinetics ",

We examine the choice of distribution by comparing the efficiency of the methods for Gaussian versus generalized q-distribution, based on the Tsallis entropy in the relocation of the probes. The two implementations of the method are tested with a series of test functions and with several Lennard-Jones clusters of various sizes. It appears that the nearest neighbor pivot method using the generalized q-distribution is superior to previous methods. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.}",

The mechanism simulates folding, which proceeds with repetitive cycles of binding, unfolding, and releasing of misfolded metastable states. We measured the yield enhancement due to this mechanism for sequences selected by evolutionary design and showed that the binding and releasing mechanism is efficient for the yield enhancement of folding for sequences that are poorly designed, i.e., where selection is not adequately strong. From this it follows that the chaperone mechanism can be considered as the evolutionary alternative to compensate for poor sequence design. On the other hand, random sequences show a decrease in yield and no effect on the total mean first passage time when the proposed chaperone mechanism is implemented, thus implying that sequence optimization is a necessary condition for the efficiency of the proposed mechanism. We qualitatively reproduced experimental results for folding in the presence of GroEL/GroES, fit our results with the aid of a double-exponential model of folding kinetics, and characterized the conditions under which this mechanism of chaperone action affects folding.}",

Specificity is introduced into the long range hydrophobic interactions by scaling back the non-native attractive component of the hydrophobic interactions through a scaling factor λ (0<λ<1). Thermodynamic properties for incremental values of λ are extrapolated from the sampling of the original (λ = 1) Hamiltonian. The results were found to be in good agreement with the thermodynamic signatures obtained by direct simulations. Decreasing the strength of the non-native attractive hydrophobic interactions leads to a more cooperative folding with the folding and collapse temperatures nearly coinciding at λ = 0.0. The free energy surfaces were also seen to become progressively smoother while retaining a pronounced native well.

This Gō-type model exhibited thermodynamic and kinetic signatures of a well-designed two-state folder with concurrent collapse and folding transitions and single exponential kinetics at the transition temperature. Topological frustration is determined in the absence of energetic frustration by the distribution of Fersht φ values. Topologically unfrustrated systems present a unimodal distribution sharply peaked at intermediate φ, whereas highly frustrated systems display a bimodal distribution peaked at low and high φ values. The distribution of φ values in protein A was determined both thermodynamically and kinetically. Both methods yielded a unimodal distribution centered at φ = 0.3 with tails extending to low and high φ values, indicating the presence of a small amount of topological frustration. The contacts with high φ values were located in the turn regions between helices I and II and II and III, intimating that these hairpins are in large part required in the transition state. Our results are in good agreement with all-atom simulations of protein A, as well as lattice simulations of a three- letter code 27-mer (which can be compared with a 60-residue helical protein). The relatively broad unimodal distribution of φ values obtained from the all-atom simulations and that from the minimalist model for the same native fold suggest that the structure of the transition state ensemble is determined mostly by the protein topology and not energetic frustration.",

In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

The folding time has a plateau over a broad range of temperatures and diverges at both high and low temperatures. The folding time depends on sequence and is related to the amount of energetic frustration in the native state. The collapse times of the chains are sequence independent and are a few orders of magnitude faster than the folding times, indicating a two‐phase folding process. Below a certain temperature the chains exhibit glasslike behavior, characterized by a slowing down of time scales and loss of self‐averaging behavior.

These simulated mutations are analyzed in terms of various kinetic and thermodynamic changes with respect to wild type, but in addition we evaluate the structure-activity relationship of our model protein based on the φ-value calculated from both the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. We find that the simulated thermodynamic φ-values reproduce the experimental trends in the mutations studied and allow us to circumvent the difficult interpretation of the complicated kinetics of our model. Furthermore, the level of resolution of the model allows us to directly predict what experiments seek in regard to protein engineering studies of protein folding - namely the residues or portions of the polypeptide chain that contribute to the crucial step in the folding of the wild-type protein.

The thermodynamics of the folding process for this model are characterized using the multiple multihistogram method combined with constant-temperature Langevin simulations. The folding is shown to be highly cooperative, with chain collapse nearly accompanying folding. Two parallel folding pathways are shown to exist on the folding free energy landscape. One pathway contains an intermediate - similar to experiments on protein G, and one pathway contains no intermediates - similar to experiments on protein L. The folding kinetics are characterized by tabulating mean-first passage times, and we show that the onset of glasslike kinetics occurs at much lower temperatures than the folding temperature.

Steered molecular dynamics simulations, in which external forces are used to explore the response and function of macromolecules, have become a powerful tool complementing and guiding in vitro single-molecule experiments. The insights provided by in silico experiments are illustrated here through a review of recent research in three areas of protein mechanics: elasticity of the muscle protein titin and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin; linker-mediated elasticity of the cytoskeleton protein spectrin; and elasticity of ankyrin repeats, a protein module found ubiquitously in cells but with an as-yet unclear function.},

To reveal the inherent structure in a given thermodynamic state, it is necessary to subject the dynamical system to steepest‐descent ‘‘quenches’’ that remove thermal motion and distortion and leave the system in the nearest mechanically stable arrangement. Such a program has been carried out via molecular dynamics simulation on an argon‐like system containing 108 atoms. Two thermodynamic states at the same reduced density (ρ∗=1.0) were considered, one just above the melting temperature T@B|m and one at approximately 3.5 T∗m . Although the pair correlation functions g(r) in these thermodynamic states differed considerably, those produced by the corresponding sets of quenches gq(r) were virtually identical. The implied inherent structure common to both states appears to be best described in terms of highly defective face‐centered‐cubic crystalline configurations. "

We explore the physical mechanism for the action of such gatekeepers, in the form of salt-bridgelike charged residues, on the early folding behavior of a model 46-mer β-barrel protein. Computer simulations employing Langevin dynamics show that the gatekeepers enhance the kinetics of folding on time scales that are about three orders of magnitude shorter than previously reported folding times for this model system. Analysis of the unfolded ensembles of the wild type (WT) β-barrel and several good and poor salt bridge designs indicates that the proteins with well designed salt-bridge gatekeepers favor productive folding routes when compared to the WT system. The conclusions of our theoretical observations are in agreement with experimental studies of the ribosomal protein S6 and its mutants. ",

Here we perform a theoretical survey of proteins of known native structure and map out the landscape of possible dynamical behaviours under stretching at constant speed. We consider 7510 proteins comprising not more than 150 amino acids and 239 longer proteins. The model used is constructed based on the native geometry. It is solved by methods of molecular dynamics and validated by comparing the theoretical predictions to experimental results. We characterize the distribution of peak forces and investigate correlations with the system size and with the structure classification as characterized by the CATH scheme. Despite the presence of such correlations, proteins with the same CATH index may belong to different classes of dynamical behaviour. We identify proteins with the biggest forces and show that they belong to few topology classes. We determine which protein segments act as mechanical clamps and show that, in most cases, they correspond to long stretches of parallel β-strands, but other mechanisms are also possible.",

Single linear molecules can be still regarded as statistical systems, where the thermodynamic limit is represented by infinitely long chains. The question of equivalence between different ensembles is not at all obvious and has been addressed in the literature, with sometimes contradicting conclusions. We address this problem by studying the scaling properties of the ensemble difference for two different chain models as a function of the degree of polymerization. By characterizing the scaling behavior of the difference between the isotensional (Gibbs) and isometric (Helmholtz) ensembles in the transition from the low-stretching to the high-stretching regime, we show that ensemble equivalence cannot be reached for macroscopic chains in the low force regime, and we characterize the transition from the inequivalence to the equivalence regime.

A sawtooth pattern was observed in the force curves where each force peak reports on the unfolding of an I27 domain. In early unfolding events, we observed a ``hump-like{''} deviation due to the detachment of beta-strand A from each I27 domain. The force at which the humps appear was similar to 130 pN and showed no temperature dependence, at least in the temperature range of 2 degrees C-30 degrees C. The hump structure was successfully analyzed with a two-state worm-like chain model, and the Gibbs free energy difference of the detachment reaction was estimated to be 11.6 +/- 0.58 kcal/mol and found to be temperature independent. By contrast, upon lowering the temperature, the mean unfolding force from the partly unfolded intermediate state was found to markedly increase and the unfolding force distribution to broaden significantly, suggesting that the distance (x(u)) between the folded and transition states in the energy landscape along the pulling direction is decreased. These results suggest that the local structure of beta-strand A are stabilized by topologically simple local hydrogen-bond network and that the temperature does not affect the detachment reaction thermodynamically and kinetically, whereas the interaction between the beta-strands A' and G, which is a critical region for its mechanical stability, is strongly dependent on the temperature.}",

Significant advances in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual framework for describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The sizes of proteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding transition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and timescales of folding are, to a large extent, determined by N, the number of residues. The intricate details of folding as a function of denaturant concentration can be predicted by using a novel coarse-grained molecular transfer model. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using single-molecule methods, investigators have established the validity of the theoretically anticipated heterogeneity in the folding routes and the N-dependent timescales for the three stages in the approach to the native state. Despite the successes of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, we conclude that much remains to be done to solve the protein folding problem in the broadest sense. ",

We show that ξp can be estimated from the force extension curve (FEC) at the extension x ≈ 1/2 (normalized by the contour length of the biopolymer). After validating the theory using simulations, we provide a quantitative analysis of the FECs for a diverse set of biopolymers (dsDNA, ssRNA, ssDNA, polysaccharides, and unstructured PEVK domain of titin) for x ≥ 1/2. The success of a specific polymer model (FJC or WLC) to describe the FEC of a given biopolymer is naturally explained by the theory. Only by probing the response of biopolymers over a wide range of forces can the f-dependent elasticity be fully described. ",

The chaperonins GroEL and GroES catalyze the folding of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase at a rate proportional to the GroEL concentration. Kinetically trapped folding-incompetent conformers of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are converted to the native state in a reaction involving multiple rounds of quantized ATP hydrolysis by GroEL. We propose that chaperonins optimize protein folding by an iterative annealing mechanism; they repeatedly bind kinetically trapped conformers, randomly disrupt their structure, and release them in less folded states, allowing substrate proteins multiple opportunities to find pathways leading to the most thermodynamically stable state. By this mechanism, chaperonins greatly expand the range of environmental conditions in which folding to the native state is possible. We suggest that the development of this device for optimizing protein folding was an early and significant evolutionary event.}",

After a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis by the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of GroEL, the bi-toroidal GroEL formed a stable asymmetric ternary complex with GroES and nucleotide (bulletlike structures). With each subsequent turnover, ATP was hydrolyzed by one ring of GroEL in a quantized manner, completely releasing the adenosine diphosphate and GroES that were tightly bound to the other ring as a result of the previous turnover. The catalytic cycle involved formation of a symmetric complex (football-like structures) as an intermediate that accumulated before the rate-determining hydrolytic step. After one to two cycles, most of the substrate protein dissociated still in a nonnative state, which is consistent with intermolecular transfer of the substrate protein between toroids of high and low affinity. A unifying model for chaperonin-facilitated protein folding based on successive rounds of binding and release, and partitioning between committed and kinetically trapped intermediates, is proposed.}",

In particular,we are able to identify the metastable states visited during the folding process by monitoring the temporal evolution of the `long-range' potentialenergy. Moreover, the resulting dynamical scenario is consistent with the picture arising from a reconstruction of the energy landscape in the vicinity of the global minimum. This suggests that the introduction of efficient `static' indicators too should properly account for the complex `orography' of the landscape.",

We derive equations for dependences of the measured quantities on the properties of molecular potential, effective stiffness of the pulling spring, and the pulling velocity. The calculations predict that the energy dissipated per an unbinding-rebinding cycle strongly increases with the steepness of the molecular potential and with decreasing the spring stiffness. A comparison of analytical results with Langevin simulations shows that the scaling relations for the barrier heights and most probable forces are more accurate in the case of active rebinding than for unbinding. Our consideration demonstrates that simultaneous analysis of probability density functions for unbinding and rebinding forces improves essentially the accuracy of retrieval information on intrinsic parameters of the molecular complex from the force measurements.

The titin molecule consists largely of tandem domains of the immuno-globulin and fibronectin-III types, together with specialized binding regions and a putative elastic region, the PEVK domain [3]. We have done mechanical experiments on single molecules of titin to determine their visco-elastic properties, using an optical-tweezers technique. On a fast (0.ls) timescale titin is elastic and force--extension data can be fitted with standard random-coil polymer models, showing that there are two main sources of elasticity: one deriving from the entropy of straightening the molecule; the other consistent with extension of the polypeptide chain in the PEVK region. On a slower timescale and above a certain force threshold, the molecule displays stress-relaxation, which occurs in rapid steps of a few piconewtons, corresponding to yielding of internal structures by about 20 nm. This stress-relaxation probably derives from unfolding of immu-noglobulin and fibronectin domains. Trinick, J. Cytoskeleton: titin as a scaffold and spring. Curr. Biol. 6, 258--260 (1996).

	abstract = "Background Recent experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein folding kinetics can be quite complex and diverse depending on various factors such as size of the protein sequence and external conditions. For example, some proteins fold apparently in a kinetically two-state manner, whereas others follow complex routes to the native state. We have set out to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse behavior seen in the refolding kinetics of proteins in terms of properties that are intrinsic to the sequence.Results: The folding kinetics of a number of sequences for off-lattice continuum models of proteins is studied using Langevin simulations at two different values of the friction coefficient. We show for these models that there is a remarkable correlation between folding time, [tau]F, and [sigma]=(T[theta] - TF)/T[theta], where T[theta] and TF are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals that several scenarios for the kinetics of refolding arise depending on the range of values of [sigma]. For relatively small [sigma], the chain reaches the native conformation by a direct native conformation nucleation collapse (NCNC) mechanism without being trapped in any detectable intermediates. For moderate and large values of [sigma], the kinetics is described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, according to which a fraction of molecules [Phi] (kinetic partition factor) reach the native conformation via the NCNC mechanism. The remaining fraction attains the native state by off-pathway processes that involve trapping in several misfolded structures. The rate-determining step in the off-pathway processes is the transition from the misfolded structures to the native state. The partition factor [Phi] is also determined by [sigma]: the smaller the value of [sigma], the larger is [Phi]. The qualitative aspects of our results are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. The simulation results and theoretical arguments are used to obtain estimates for timescales for folding via the NCNC mechanism in small proteins, those with less than about 70 amino acid residues.Conclusions We have shown that the various scenarios for folding of proteins, and possibly other biomolecules, can be classified solely in terms of [sigma]. Proteins with small values of [sigma] reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by having one dominant native basin of attraction (NBA). On the other hand, proteins with large [sigma] get trapped in competing basins of attraction (CBAs) in which they adopt misfolded structures. Only a small fraction of molecules access the native state rapidly when [sigma] is large. For these sequences, the majority of the molecules approach the native state by a three-stage multipathway mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves a transition from one of the CBAs to the NBA.",

	abstract = {Familiar concepts for small molecules may require reinterpretation for larger systems. For example, rearrangements between geometrical isomers are usually considered in terms of transitions between the corresponding local minima on the underlying potential energy surface, V. However, transitions between bulk phases such as solid and liquid, or between the denatured and native states of a protein, are normally addressed in terms of free energy minima. To reestablish a connection with the potential energy surface we must think in terms of representative samples of local minima of V, from which a free energy surface is projected by averaging over most of the coordinates. The present contribution outlines how this connection can be developed into a tool for quantitative calculations. In particular, stepping between the local minima of V provides powerful methods for locating the global potential energy minimum, and for calculating global thermodynamic properties. When the transition states that link local minima are also sampled we can exploit statistical rate theory to obtain insight into global dynamics and rare events. Visualizing the potential energy landscape helps to explain how the network of local minima and transition states determines properties such as heat capacity features, which signify transitions between free energy minima. The organization of the landscape also reveals how certain systems can reliably locate particular structures on the experimental time scale from among an exponentially large number of local minima. Such directed searches not only enable proteins to overcome Levinthal's paradox but may also underlie the formation of "magic numbers" in molecular beams, the self-assembly of macromolecular structures, and crystallization.},

First we demonstrate how the potential energy surface can be partitioned into catchment basins associated with every stationary point using a combination of Newton--Raphson and eigenvector-following techniques. Numerical results are presented for a 256-atom supercell representation of a binary Lennard-Jones system. We then derive analytical formulae for the number of stationary points as a function of both system size and the Hessian index, using a framework based upon weakly interacting subsystems. This analysis reveals a simple relation between the total number of stationary points, the number of local minima, and the number of transition states connected on average to each minimum. Finally we calculate two measures of localization for the displacements corresponding to Hessian eigenvectors in samples of stationary points obtained from the Newton--Raphson-based geometry optimization scheme. Systematic differences are found between the properties of eigenvectors corresponding to positive and negative Hessian eigenvalues, and localized character is most pronounced for stationary points with low values of the Hessian index.

This method has been designed to exploit the features that recent work suggests must be present in an energy landscape for efficient relaxation to the global minimum. The transformation associates any point in configuration space with the local minimum obtained by a geometry optimization started from that point, effectively removing transition state regions from the problem. However, unlike other methods based upon hypersurface deformation, this transformation does not change the global minimum. The lowest known structures are located for all Lennard-Jones clusters up to 110 atoms, including a number that have never been found before in unbiased searches. ",

First we consider a cluster of 38 Lennard-Jones particles, whose energy landscape is a `double funnel' on which relaxation to the global minimum is diverted into a set of competing structures. Then we characterize the energy landscape associated with the annealing of C-60 cages to buckministerfullerene, and show that it provides experimentally accessible clues to the relaxation pathway. Finally we show a very different landscape morphology, that of a model water cluster (H2O)(20), and show how it exhibits features expected for a `strong' liquid.

All the pathways have been recomputed for a number of different empirical potentials, some of which reproduce the two lowest energy degenerate rearrangements quite well.

Although molecular-level experiments have enabled sampling of individual ligand-receptor complex dissociation events, disparities in measured unbinding force F(R) among these methods lead to marked variation in inferred binding energetics and kinetics at equilibrium. These discrepancies are documented for even the ubiquitous ligand-receptor pair, biotin-streptavidin. We investigated these disparities and examined atomic-level unbinding trajectories via steered molecular dynamics simulations, as well as via molecular force spectroscopy experiments on biotin-streptavidin. In addition to the well-known loading rate dependence of F(R) predicted by Bell's model, we find that experimentally accessible parameters such as the effective stiffness of the force transducer k can significantly perturb the energy landscape and the apparent unbinding force of the complex for sufficiently stiff force transducers. Additionally, at least 20\% variation in unbinding force can be attributed to minute differences in initial atomic positions among energetically and structurally comparable complexes. For force transducers typical of molecular force spectroscopy experiments and atomistic simulations, this energy barrier perturbation results in extrapolated energetic and kinetic parameters of the complex that depend strongly on k. We present a model that explicitly includes the effect of k on apparent unbinding force of the ligand-receptor complex, and demonstrate that this correction enables prediction of unbinding distances and dissociation rates that are decoupled from the stiffness of actual or simulated molecular linkers.",

In this paper we show that, within what we call the potential-energy-landscape ensemble, it is possible to make direct connections between the geometry of the landscape and the long-time dynamical behaviors of systems such as supercooled liquids. We show, in particular, that the onset of slow dynamics in such systems is governed directly by the lengths of their geodesics—the shortest paths through their landscapes within the special ensemble. The more convoluted and labyrinthine these geodesics are, the slower that dynamics is. Geodesics in the landscape ensemble have sufficiently well-defined characteristics that it is straightforward to search for them numerically, a point we illustrate by computing the geodesic lengths for an ordinary atomic liquid and a binary glass-forming atomic mixture. We find that the temperature dependence of the diffusion constants of these systems, including the precipitous drop as the glass-forming system approaches its empirical mode-coupling transition, is predicted quantitatively by the growth of the geodesic path lengths.

But what are the principal geometric features that control the long-time dynamics? We suggest that the key lies not in the local minima and saddles of the landscape, but in a more global property of the surface: its accessible pathways. In order to make this notion more precise we introduce two ideas: (1) a switch to a new ensemble that deemphasizes the concept of potential barriers, and (2) a way of finding optimum pathways within this new ensemble. The potential energy landscape ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum accessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control variable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent to the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers it allows us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We illustrate these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the Kob-Andersen [Phys. Rev. E 51, 4626 (1995)] of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the process, that the landscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a connectivity transition at the landscape energy associated with its empirical mode-coupling transition. We turn to the problem of finding the most efficient pathways through potential energy landscapes in our companion paper. ",

This is the meaning of the Jarzynski equality (JE), which we test in this paper by performing simulations that unfold a protein by pulling two atoms apart. Pulling is performed fast relative to the relaxation time of the molecule and is thus far from equilibrium. Choosing a simple protein model for which we can independently compute its equilibrium properties, we show that the free energy can be exactly and effectively estimated from nonequilibrium simulations. To do so, one must carefully and correctly determine the ensemble of states that are pulled, which is more important the farther from equilibrium one performs simulations; this highlights a potential problem in using the JE to extract the free energy from forced unfolding experiments. The results presented here also demonstrate that the free energy difference between the native and denatured states of a protein measured in solution is not always equal to the free energy profile that can be estimated from forced unfolding simulations (or experiments) using the JE.},

The molecular vibrational dynamics, which we find to play a central role in these processes, is simulated by following constant energy trajectories under specially generated initial conditions. Employing this scheme with a carbon tight-binding potential, we have observed sequential C2 loss from C60, as well as the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds on the fullerene cage. Our successful approach is a departure from previously employed constant temperature schemes. ",

	abstract = " The unfolding of a protein by the application of an external force pulling two atoms of the protein can be detected by atomic force and optical tweezers technologies as have been broadly demonstrated in the past decade. Variation of the applied force results in a modulation of the free-energy barrier to unfolding and thus, the rate of the process, which is often assumed to have single exponential kinetics. It has been recently shown that it is experimentally feasible, through the use of force clamps, to estimate the distribution of unfolding times for a population of proteins initially in the native state. In this Letter we show how the analysis of such distributions under a range of forces can provide unique information about the underlying free-energy surface such as the height of the free-energy barrier, the preexponential factor and the force dependence of the unfolding kinetics without resorting to ad hoc kinetic models.

Thus far, experiments have been mostly analyzed with one-dimensional models of the free-energy landscape. We show that as the two ends of a protein, filamin, are pulled apart at a speed tending to zero, the measured mechanical strength plateaus at ∼30 pN instead of going toward zero, deviating from the Bell model. The deviation can only be explained by a switch between parallel pathways. Insightful analysis of mechanical unfolding kinetics needs to account for the multidimensionality of the free-energy landscapes of proteins, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of proteins under the small forces experienced in vivo.",
