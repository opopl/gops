	abstract = " The prediction of the three-dimensional native structure of proteins from the knowledge of their amino acid sequence, known as the protein folding problem, is one of the most important yet unsolved issues of modern science. Since the conformational behaviour of flexible molecules is nothing more than a complex physical problem, increasingly more physicists are moving into the study of protein systems, bringing with them powerful mathematical and computational tools, as well as the sharp intuition and deep images inherent to the physics discipline. This work attempts to facilitate the first steps of such a transition. In order to achieve this goal, we provide an exhaustive account of the reasons underlying the protein folding problem enormous relevance and summarize the present-day status of the methods aimed to solving it. We also provide an introduction to the particular structure of these biological heteropolymers, and we physically define the problem stating the assumptions behind this (commonly implicit) definition. Finally, we review the `special flavor' of statistical mechanics that is typically used to study the astronomically large phase spaces of macromolecules. Throughout the whole work, much material that is found scattered in the literature has been put together here to improve comprehension and to serve as a handy reference. ",

	abstract = "We have studied the folding mechanism of lattice model 36-mer proteins. Using a simulated annealing procedure in sequence space, we have designed sequences to have sufficiently low energy in a given target conformation, which plays the role of the native structure in our study. The sequence design algorithm generated sequences for which the native structures is a pronounced global energy minimum. Then, designed sequences were subjected to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of folding. In each run, starting from a random coil conformation, the chain reached its native structure, which is indicative that the model proteins solve the Levinthal paradox. The folding mechanism involved nucleation growth. Formation of a specific nucleus, which is a particular pattern of contacts, is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for subsequent rapid folding to the native state. The nucleus represents a transition state of folding to the molten globule conformation. The search for the nucleus is a rate-limiting step of folding and corresponds to overcoming the major free energy barrier. We also observed a folding pathway that is the approach to the native state after nucleus formation; this stage takes about 1\% of the simulation time. The nucleus is a spatially localized substructure of the native state having 8 out of 40 native contacts. However, monomers belonging to the nucleus are scattered along the sequence, so that several nucleus contacts are long-range while other are short-range. A folding nucleus was also found in a longer chain 80-mer, where it also constituted 20\% of the native structure. The possible mechanism of folding of designed proteins, as well as the experimental implications of this study is discussed.",

However, when this frustration is removed in a G≈ç-type model, the number of coordinates required is significantly lower, especially around the global potential energy minimum. To aid our interpretation of the results we consider modified disconnectivity graphs where a measure of the structural diversity and a metric relation between the stationary points are incorporated.

This procedure uniquely identifies a non-Gaussian distribution of the observable associated with each local equilibrium state (LES). Both the number of LESs and the shape of the non-Gaussian distributions depend on the time scale of observation. By assessing how often the system visits and resides in a chosen LES and escapes from one LES to another (with checking whether the local detailed balance is satisfied), our scheme naturally leads to an effective free energy landscape whose topography depends on in which time scale the system experiences the underlying landscape. For example, two metastable states are unified as one if the time scale of observation is longer than the escape time scale for which the system can visit mutually these two states. As an illustrative example, we present the application of extracting the effective free energy landscapes from time series of the end-to-end distance of a three-color, 46-bead model protein. It indicates that the time scales to attain the local equilibrium tend to be longer in the unfolded state than those in the compact collapsed state.",

	abstract = "The unbinding dynamics of complexes involving cell-adhesion molecules depends on the specific ligands. Atomic force microscopy measurements have shown that for the specific P-selectin-P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (sPSGL-1) the average bond lifetime t initially increases (catch bonds) at low (< or =10 pN) constant force, f, and decreases when f > 10 pN (slip bonds). In contrast, for the complex with G1 anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody t monotonically decreases with f. To quantitatively map the energy landscape of such complexes we use a model that considers the possibility of redistribution of population from one force-free state to another force-stabilized bound state. The excellent agreement between theory and experiments allows us to extract energy landscape parameters by fitting the calculated curves to the lifetime measurements for both sPSGL-1 and G1. Surprisingly, the unbinding transition state for P-selectin-G1 complex is close (0.32 nm) to the bound state, implying that the interaction is brittle, i.e., once deformed, the complex fractures. In contrast, the unbinding transition state of the P-selectin-sPSGL-1 complex is far (approximately 1.5 nm) from the bound state, indicative of a compliant structure. Constant f energy landscape parameters are used to compute the distributions of unbinding times and unbinding forces as a function of the loading rate, rf. For a given rf, unbinding of sPSGL-1 occurs over a broader range of f with the most probable f being an order of magnitude less than for G1. The theory for cell adhesion complexes can be used to predict the outcomes of unbinding of other protein-protein complexes.",

	Abstract = "{We investigated the effect of temperature on the mechanical unfolding of I27 from human cardiac titin, employing a custom-built temperature control device for single-molecule atomic force microscopy measurement. A sawtooth pattern was observed in the force curves where each force peak reports on the unfolding of an I27 domain. In early unfolding events, we observed a ``hump-like{''} deviation due to the detachment of beta-strand A from each I27 domain. The force at which the humps appear was similar to 130 pN and showed no temperature dependence, at least in the temperature range of 2 degrees C-30 degrees C. The hump structure was successfully analyzed with a two-state worm-like chain model, and the Gibbs free energy difference of the detachment reaction was estimated to be 11.6 +/- 0.58 kcal/mol and found to be temperature independent. By contrast, upon lowering the temperature, the mean unfolding force from the partly unfolded intermediate state was found to markedly increase and the unfolding force distribution to broaden significantly, suggesting that the distance (x(u)) between the folded and transition states in the energy landscape along the pulling direction is decreased. These results suggest that the local structure of beta-strand A are stabilized by topologically simple local hydrogen-bond network and that the temperature does not affect the detachment reaction thermodynamically and kinetically, whereas the interaction between the beta-strands A' and G, which is a critical region for its mechanical stability, is strongly dependent on the temperature.}",

	Abstract = "{Topological characteristics of multidimensional potential energy surfaces are explored and the full conformation space is mapped on the set of local minima. This map partitions conformation space into energy-dependent or temperature-dependent `'attraction basins'' and generates `'disconnectivity'' graph that reflects the basin connectivity and characterizes the shape of the multidimensional surface. The partitioning of the conformation space is used to express the temporal behavior of the system in terms of basin-to-basin kinetics instead of the usual state-to-state transitions. For this purpose the transition matrix of the system is expressed in terms of basin-to-basin transitions and the corresponding master equation is solved. As an example, the approach is applied to the tetrapeptide, isobutyryl-(ala)(3)-NH-methyl (IAN), which is the shortest peptide that can form a full helical turn. A nearly complete List of minima and barriers is available for this system from the work of Czerminiski and Elber. The multidimensional potential energy surface of the peptide is shown to exhibit an overall `'funnel'' shape. The relation between connectivity and spatial proximity in dihedral angle space is examined. It is found that, although the two are similar, closeness in one does not always imply closeness in the other. The basin to basin kinetics is examined using a master equation and the results are interpreted in terms of kinetic connectivity. The conformation space of the peptide is divided up in terms of the surface topography to model its `'folding'' behavior. Even in this very simple system, the kinetics exhibit a `'trapping'' state which appears as a `'kinetic intermediate,'' as in the folding of proteins. The approach described here can be used more generally to classify multidimensional potential energy surface sand the time development of complex systems. (C) 1997 American Institute of Physics.}",

This method makes use of a high energy barrier between the native state and transient folding intermediates, and, in contrast to conventional optical techniques, it enables one to specifically monitor the amount of native molecules during protein folding. The results show that under strongly native conditions lysozyme can refold on parallel pathways. The major part of the lysozyme molecules (86\%) refold on a slow kinetic pathway with well-populated partially folded states. Additionally, 14\% of the molecules fold faster. The rate constant of formation of native molecules on the fast pathway corresponds well to the rate constant expected for folding to occur by a two-state process without any detectable intermediates. The results suggest that formation of the native state for the major fraction of lysozyme molecules is retarded compared with the direct folding process. Partially structured intermediates that transiently populate seem to be kinetically trapped in a conformation that can only slowly reach the native structure.}",

	Abstract = "{We investigated a chaperone mechanism of protein folding using a 36-mer model on a cubic lattice. The mechanism simulates folding, which proceeds with repetitive cycles of binding, unfolding, and releasing of misfolded metastable states. We measured the yield enhancement due to this mechanism for sequences selected by evolutionary design and showed that the binding and releasing mechanism is efficient for the yield enhancement of folding for sequences that are poorly designed, i.e., where selection is not adequately strong. From this it follows that the chaperone mechanism can be considered as the evolutionary alternative to compensate for poor sequence design. On the other hand, random sequences show a decrease in yield and no effect on the total mean first passage time when the proposed chaperone mechanism is implemented, thus implying that sequence optimization is a necessary condition for the efficiency of the proposed mechanism. We qualitatively reproduced experimental results for folding in the presence of GroEL/GroES, fit our results with the aid of a double-exponential model of folding kinetics, and characterized the conditions under which this mechanism of chaperone action affects folding.}",

Since folding in vivo often requires the action of chaperone molecules and ATP hydrolysis, we must ask whether folding in a system maintained away from equilibrium can avoid the Levinthal paradox in other ways. We describe a model of the action of chaperone molecules in protein folding in vivo on the basis of a repetitive cycle of binding and unbinding, allowing the possibility of kinetic proofreading. We also study models in which chaperone binding is locally biased, depending on the similarity of the conformation to the native one. We show that while kinetic proofreading can modestly facilitate folding, it is insufficient by itself to overcome the Levinthal paradox. On the other hand, such kinetic proofreading with biasing can provide the nonequilibrium analog of a folding funnel and greatly enhance folding yields and speed up folding.}",

The chaperonins GroEL and GroES catalyze the folding of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase at a rate proportional to the GroEL concentration. Kinetically trapped folding-incompetent conformers of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are converted to the native state in a reaction involving multiple rounds of quantized ATP hydrolysis by GroEL. We propose that chaperonins optimize protein folding by an iterative annealing mechanism; they repeatedly bind kinetically trapped conformers, randomly disrupt their structure, and release them in less folded states, allowing substrate proteins multiple opportunities to find pathways leading to the most thermodynamically stable state. By this mechanism, chaperonins greatly expand the range of environmental conditions in which folding to the native state is possible. We suggest that the development of this device for optimizing protein folding was an early and significant evolutionary event.}",

After a single cycle of ATP hydrolysis by the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of GroEL, the bi-toroidal GroEL formed a stable asymmetric ternary complex with GroES and nucleotide (bulletlike structures). With each subsequent turnover, ATP was hydrolyzed by one ring of GroEL in a quantized manner, completely releasing the adenosine diphosphate and GroES that were tightly bound to the other ring as a result of the previous turnover. The catalytic cycle involved formation of a symmetric complex (football-like structures) as an intermediate that accumulated before the rate-determining hydrolytic step. After one to two cycles, most of the substrate protein dissociated still in a nonnative state, which is consistent with intermolecular transfer of the substrate protein between toroids of high and low affinity. A unifying model for chaperonin-facilitated protein folding based on successive rounds of binding and release, and partitioning between committed and kinetically trapped intermediates, is proposed.}",

The time course of protection from exchange has been measured for 26 backbone amide protons that form stable hydrogen bonds upon refolding and exchange slowly under native conditions. Amide protons in the beta-sheet and the alpha-helix, as well as protons involved in hydrogen bonds at the helix/sheet interface, become 80\% protected in an initial 8-ms folding phase, indicating that the two elements of secondary structure form and associate in a common cooperative folding event. Somewhat slower protection rates for residues 59, 61, and 69 provide evidence for the subsequent stabilization of a surface loop. Most probes also exhibit two minor phases with time constants of about 100 ms and 10 s. Only two of the observed residues, Gln-41 and Arg-42, display significant slow folding phases, with amplitudes of 37\% and 22\%, respectively, which can be attributed to native-like folding intermediates containing cis peptide bonds for Pro-37 and/or Pro-38. Compared with other proteins studied by pulse labeling, including cytochrome c, ribonuclease, and barnase, the initial formation of hydrogen-bonded structure in ubiquitin occurs at a more rapid rate and slow-folding species are less prominent.}",

Liquid (KCl)32 was quenched to investigate how fast the cooling rate must be to trap (KCl)32 in one of the high‚Äêenergy amorphous structures. Even at unrealistically fast cooling rates, (KCl)32 was able to locate its microcrystal structure. A shielded Coulomb interaction potential was used to test whether reducing the range of the pairwise potential would make it possible to prepare amorphous binary clusters. Several different values of the shielding range were tested. These results are discussed in terms of the structure of the underlying potential energy surface. A short study was conducted of the temperature dependence of the time it takes, on average, for supercooled (KCl)32 to relax into the crystalline regions of its potential energy surface. Lastly, we rationalize, in terms of the potential energy surface, the qualitative temperature dependence of the heat capacity for both the first‚Äêorder and glass transitions. "

So far, mechanical information about molecular bond mechanics has been largely limited to a single direction of force application. However, mechanical force acts as a vector in space and hence mechanical stability should depend on the direction of force application. In skeletal muscle, the giant protein titin is anchored in the Z-disk by telethonin. Much of the structural integrity of the Z-disk hinges upon the titin-telethonin bond. In this paper we show that the complex between the muscle proteins titin and telethonin forms a highly directed molecular bond. It is designed to resist ultra-high forces if they are applied in the direction along which it is loaded under physiological conditions, while it breaks easily along other directions. Highly directed molecular bonds match in an ideal way the requirements of tissues subject to mechanical stress.",

Determining intrinsic kinetic information, at zero stretching force, usually requires an extrapolation by fitting a theoretical model. Here, we apply a recent theoretical approach describing molecular rupture in the presence of force to unfolding kinetic data obtained from coarse-grained simulations of ubiquitin. Unfolding rates calculated from simulations over a broad range of stretching forces, for different pulling directions, reveal a remarkable "turnover" from a force-independent process at low force to a force-dependent process at high force, akin to the "roll-over" in unfolding rates sometimes seen in studies using chemical denaturant. While such a turnover in rates is unexpected in one dimension, we demonstrate that it can occur for dynamics in just two dimensions. We relate the turnover to the quality of the pulling direction as a reaction coordinate for the intrinsic folding mechanism. A novel pulling direction, designed to be the most relevant to the intrinsic folding pathway, results in the smallest turnover. Our results are in accord with protein engineering experiments and simulations which indicate that the unfolding mechanism at high force can differ from the intrinsic mechanism. The apparent similarity between extrapolated and intrinsic rates in experiments, unexpected for different unfolding barriers, can be explained if the turnover occurs at low forces.},

	abstract = "Atomic force spectroscopy has become a widely used technique for investigating forces, energies, and dynamics of biomolecular interactions. These studies provide dissociation kinetic parameters by pulling apart proteins involved in a complex. Biological complexes are studied under near-physiological conditions, without labeling procedures, and are probed one at time, the latter allowing to one obtain results which are not averaged over the ensemble. However, to gain reliable information, some experimental aspects have to be carefully controlled. In particular, the immobilization of molecular partners to AFM tips and supports, required to force the molecular dissociation, plays a crucial role in determining the success of the experiments. To actually resolve single interactions, multiple simultaneous complex dissociations have to be avoided, and nonspecific adhesions, commonly found in these studies, have to be recognized and discarded. This article is aimed at offering a critical revisitation of the atomic force spectroscopy technique applied to the study of biomolecular interactions, highlighting the critical points, identifying strategies to be adopted for a more reliable data extraction and interpretation, and pointing out the experimental and theoretical aspects which still need to be refined. To this purpose, we take advantage of the vast landscape of literature and then proceed into the details of our works. In this respect, we describe the general principles of the technique, the procedures for protein immobilization, and how they can affect the results. We emphasize the use of computational docking to predict molecular complex configurations, when unknown, as a useful approach to select proper anchorage architectures. Additionally, we deal with data acquirement and analysis, with regard to the force curve selection, to the force histograms interpretation, and to the theoretical frameworks used to extract kinetic parameters. Through this, we outline that AFS can be successfully used both to investigate complexes having very different affinities and also to reveal competitive binding mechanisms, thus gaining deeper information about molecular interactions.",

For a loading rate beyond the upper limit of the scaling regime, the bond rupture is deterministic and the thermal effects are negligible. For a loading rate below the lower limit of the scaling regime, the contribution from rebinding becomes important and there is no simple scaling relation between the rupture force and the loading rate.

The approach proves to be efficient for systems involving broken ergodicity and has allowed us to calculate converged heat capacity curves for systems that could previously only be treated using the harmonic superposition approximation. Benchmarks are also provided by comparison with parallel tempering and Wang-Landau simulations, where these proved feasible.},

Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions.",

The kinetics are probed by several correlation functions and are interpreted in terms of the underlying energy landscape. The transition from the coil to the native state occurs in three distinct stages. The initial stage corresponds to a random collapse of the protein chain. At intermediate times tau c, during which much of the native structure is acquired, there are multiple pathways. For longer times tau r (>> tau c) the decay is exponential, suggestive of a late transition state. The folding time scale (approximately tau r) varies greatly depending on the model.

In this paper we show that, within what we call the potential-energy-landscape ensemble, it is possible to make direct connections between the geometry of the landscape and the long-time dynamical behaviors of systems such as supercooled liquids. We show, in particular, that the onset of slow dynamics in such systems is governed directly by the lengths of their geodesics‚Äîthe shortest paths through their landscapes within the special ensemble. The more convoluted and labyrinthine these geodesics are, the slower that dynamics is. Geodesics in the landscape ensemble have sufficiently well-defined characteristics that it is straightforward to search for them numerically, a point we illustrate by computing the geodesic lengths for an ordinary atomic liquid and a binary glass-forming atomic mixture. We find that the temperature dependence of the diffusion constants of these systems, including the precipitous drop as the glass-forming system approaches its empirical mode-coupling transition, is predicted quantitatively by the growth of the geodesic path lengths.

In the high-friction (diffusive) limit of Langevin dynamics, the resulting ensemble of transition states is shown to coincide with the separatrix formed by points of equal commitment (or splitting) probabilities for reaching the product and reactant regions. Transition states according to the new criterion can be identified directly from equilibrium trajectories, or indirectly by calculating probability densities in the equilibrium and transition-path ensembles using umbrella and transition-path sampling, respectively.

But what are the principal geometric features that control the long-time dynamics? We suggest that the key lies not in the local minima and saddles of the landscape, but in a more global property of the surface: its accessible pathways. In order to make this notion more precise we introduce two ideas: (1) a switch to a new ensemble that deemphasizes the concept of potential barriers, and (2) a way of finding optimum pathways within this new ensemble. The potential energy landscape ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum accessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control variable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent to the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers it allows us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We illustrate these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the Kob-Andersen [Phys. Rev. E 51, 4626 (1995)] of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the process, that the landscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a connectivity transition at the landscape energy associated with its empirical mode-coupling transition. We turn to the problem of finding the most efficient pathways through potential energy landscapes in our companion paper. "

	abstract = " Interpolation methods such as the nudged elastic band and string methods are widely used for calculating minimum energy pathways and transition states for chemical reactions. Both methods require an initial guess for the reaction pathway. A poorly chosen initial guess can cause slow convergence, convergence to an incorrect pathway, or even failed electronic structure force calculations along the guessed pathway. This paper presents a growing string method that can find minimum energy pathways and transition states without the requirement of an initial guess for the pathway. The growing string begins as two string fragments, one associated with the reactants and the other with the products. Each string fragment is grown separately until the fragments converge. Once the two fragments join, the full string moves toward the minimum energy pathway according to the algorithm for the string method. This paper compares the growing string method to the string method and to the nudged elastic band method using the alanine dipeptide rearrangement as an example. In this example, for which the linearly interpolated guess is far from the minimum energy pathway, the growing string method finds the saddle point with significantly fewer electronic structure force calculations than the string method or the nudged elastic band method.

At the molecular level, we apply the method to tautomerization processes in nucleic acid bases and the double proton transfer in nucleic acid base pairs. For bulk systems, we considered the concerted exchange mechanism in Si, which is a complicated pathway for defect-free diffusion in the diamond lattice. For surface systems, we considered ad-dimer diffusion mechanisms on Si(100). We incorporated the climbing image extension of the nudged elastic band method and compared it against the original approach on two-dimensional model potential energy surfaces. Based on favorable comparisons with related methods and the general implementation of our method, we believe that this is well suited for efficient estimates of activation barriers with sophisticated electronic structure codes.

For each state of the system, characterized by a local minimum on the potential energy surface, multiple searches for saddle points are carried out using random initial directions. The dimer method is used for the saddle point searches and the rate for each transition mechanism is estimated using harmonic transition state theory. Transitions are selected and the clock advanced according to the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. Unlike traditional applications of kinetic Monte Carlo, the atoms are not assumed to sit on lattice sites and a list of all possible transitions need not be specified beforehand. Rather, the relevant transitions are found on the fly during the simulation. A multiple time scale simulation of Al(100) crystal growth is presented where the deposition event, occurring on the time scale of picoseconds, is simulated by ordinary classical dynamics, but the time interval in between deposition events, on the order of milliseconds, is simulated by the long time scale algorithm. The Al(100) surface is found to grow remarkably smooth, even at 30 K because of concerted displacements of multiple atoms with significantly lower activation energy than adatom diffusion on the flat terrace.

this review is to consider modern understanding of physical principles of
self-organization of protein structures and to overview such important features
of this process, as finding out the unique protein structure among zillions
alternatives, nucleation of the folding process and metastable folding
intermediates. Towards this end we will consider the main experimental facts
and simple, mostly phenomenological theoretical models. We will concentrate on
relatively small (single-domain) water-soluble globular proteins (whose
structure and especially folding are much better studied and understood than
those of large or membrane and fibrous proteins) and consider kinetic and
structural aspects of transition of initially unfolded protein chains into
their final solid ("native") 3D structures." }

The purpose of this paper is to elucidate this problem and to estimate the rate of folding to the most stable structure near the point of thermodynamic equilibrium between this structure and the coil.Results Folding is rapid when it occurs in the vicinity of a thermodynamic [`]all-or-none' transition from the coil to the lowest-energy fold: here the misfolded and semifolded states cannot [`]trap' the folding chain since, even taken together, all these states are less stable than both the initial coil and the final stable fold of the chain. A stable globular structure can be rapidly achieved via a [`]nucleation-and-growth' folding pathway that provides a continuous entropy-by-energy compensation along the folding pathway and thus provides a low free energy of the transition state.Conclusion At the point of transition of the coil to the lowest-energy fold, an N-residue chain folds normally in ~exp(N2/3) ns. Therefore, a 100-residue chain finds its most stable fold within minutes rather than in 10100 ps [approximate] 1080 years, according to the famous paradoxical estimate of Levinthal."

	title = "Optimization methods for finding minimum energy paths",
	abstract = " A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).

Ideally these directions are chosen so the updated Hessian gives steps that are same as using the Newton method. Three approaches to determine the directions for updating are presented: the straightforward approach of simply cycling through the Cartesian unit vectors (finite difference), a concurrent set of minimizations, and the Lanczos method. We show the importance of using preconditioning and a multiple secant update in these approaches. For the Lanczos algorithm, an initial set of directions is required to start the method, and a number of possibilities are explored. To test the methods we used the standard 50-dimensional analytic Rosenbrock function. Results are also reported for the histidine dipeptide, the isoleucine tripeptide, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate.

An explicit solution is provided for the optimal planar dividing surface for multidimensional dissipative systems whose equations of motion are given in terms of coupled generalized Langevin equations. In addition to the usual dependence on friction, the optimal planar dividing surface is temperature dependent. This temperature dependence leads to a temperature dependent barrier frequency whose zero temperature limit in the one dimensional case is just the usual Kramers--Grote--Hynes reactive frequency. In this way, the Kramers--Grote--Hynes equation for the barrier frequency is generalized to include the effect of nonlinearities in the system potential. Consideration of the optimal planar dividing surface leads to a unified treatment of a variety of problems. These are (a) extension of the Kramers--Grote--Hynes theory for the transmission coefficient to include finite barrier heights, (b) generalization of Langer‚Äôs theory for multidimensional systems to include both memory friction and finite barrier height corrections, (c) Langer‚Äôs equation for the reactive frequency in the multidimensional case is generalized to include the dependence on friction and the nonlinearity of the multidimensional potential, (d) derivation of the non‚ÄêKramers limit for the transmission coefficient in the case of anisotropic friction, (e) the generalized theory allows for the possibility of a shift of the optimal planar dividing surface away from the saddle point, this shift is friction and temperature dependent, (f) a perturbative solution of the generalized equations is presented for the one and two dimensional cases and applied to cubic and quartic potentials.

We obtain that after (m/delta)(a center dot D) Markov chain transitions the probability to be in a minimum energy conformation is at least 1 - delta, where m <= b(d) center dot n is the maximum neighbourhood size (h(d) small integer), a is a small constant, and D is the maximum value of the minimum escape height from local minima of the underlying energy landscape. We note that the time bound is instance-specific, and we conjecture D < n(1-1/d) as a worst case upper bound. We analyse D < root n experimentally on selected benchmark problerns for the d = 2 case.

	abstract = " The Stone-Wales transformation has been proposed as a basic process for ring rearrangement in a fullerene cage and, consequently, for annealing fullerene structures down to the ground state. We present a new, thermally activated, mechanism for the Stone-Wales transformation. This mechanism, found in dynamical simulations of C60, involves a multi-step isomerization transition process in contrast with the commonly assumed single-step mechanism. The step-to-step energy barriers found in the multistep process are much lower than the reported ones for single-setp process. We also present a dynamical simulation of the thermal fullerene-to-graphite reconstruction of C60 of relevance to the growth of fullerenes. The two thermal processes presented open new roads for investigating the formation and annealing mechanisms of different carbon structures."

The molecular vibrational dynamics, which we find to play a central role in these processes, is simulated by following constant energy trajectories under specially generated initial conditions. Employing this scheme with a carbon tight-binding potential, we have observed sequential C2 loss from C60, as well as the rearrangement of carbon-carbon bonds on the fullerene cage. Our successful approach is a departure from previously employed constant temperature schemes. ",

We present applications to the formation of buckminsterfullerene and to the folding of various biomolecules: the B1 domain of protein G, tryptophan zippers, and the villin headpiece subdomain.

HH contacts are favorable. The conformational landscape is found by exhaustive enumeration using two different move sets, and time evolution is modeled by a transition matrix with the Metropolis criterion. The kinetic sequence of folding events depends strongly on both the monomer sequence and on the move set. But certain features are common to all sequences with both move sets. Beginning with open conformations, chains fold through multiple paths, are slowed by kinetic traps, and accumulate in compact nonnative conformations. Most chains must surmount energy barriers, which we identify as the transition state. Strikingly, the transition state involves a chain expansion, due to the breaking of HH contacts of compact denatured conformations. Mutations can significantly affect the energy landscape and folding dynamics, but in ways that appear too subtle to predict just from knowledge of native structures. Consistent with other models, we find that sequences with a large energy gap between the native and the next higher energy level can be stable and fold rapidly "

Comparison of the computed lowest-energy structures of two of them (HDEA and MarA) with the crystal structures, released by the Protein Data Bank after the predictions were made, shows that large fragments (61 residues) of both proteins were predicted with rms deviations of 4.2 and 6.0 Angstrom for the Ca atoms, for HDEA and MarA, respectively. This represents 80\% and 53\% of the observed structures of HDEA and MarA respectively. Similar rms deviations were obtained for similar to 60-residue fragments of the other three proteins. These results constitute an important step toward the prediction of protein structure based solely on global optimization of a potential energy function for a given amino acid sequence.}",

Effective sampling of the protein conformations over the folding transition is achieved by an entropy sampling procedure, combined with a stochastically biased conformation-generating scheme and a jump-walking algorithm. Comparative analyses are carried out for optimally designed sequences and randomly selected sequences in terms of four properties: (a) the thermal folding/unfolding transitions of the different sequences; (b) the distributions of conformational populations at the corresponding transition temperatures of the sequences; (c) the fitting of the simulation results to an analytical theory; and (d) the distributions of local energy minima and the energy barriers between them in different conformational regions. It is found that all the polypeptides studied here exhibit rather sharp transitions at their folding temperatures. However, the designed/optimized sequences exhibit long-range cooperative behavior in the folding transition, while the random sequences reflect only short-range (i.e., nearest-neighbor) cooperative phenomena. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimized sequences fold to unique lowest-energy structures, but that the random sequences, when cooled, fold to compact but in general random structures. This study demonstrates that whether or not a polypeptide folds to the lowest-energy structure can be determined from its sequence by statistical mechanical characteristics. The implication of biological evolution in determining protein sequences is discussed.}",

Combined with a master equation, we show that if constructed with proper regularity, the kinetics of the PES is easy to predict and understand by carefully examining the eigenmodes of the master equation. By modifying the idealized PES model to make it more and more complicated, we demonstrate a systematic method to study the complex kinetics on large PES. The idealized PES model is used to explore the feasibility and the robustness of statistical sampling of large PES. We develop several sampling strategies, such as the ``rough topography sampling'' and the ``low barrier saddle sampling'' in the idealized PES model and find they are also applicable to a realistic PES of the 13-atom Morse cluster with range parameter rho = 6. To measure the robustness of the sampling methods, we compare the eigenvalue spectra, the eigenvector similarity and the relaxation times of the total energy of the full and sample PESs.}",

	Abstract = "{In this paper the statistical mechanical properties are investigated of a simple analytical model which is based loosely on a cluster of atoms. The model has a phase transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like phase. Particular interest is paid to the dependence of the nature of this phase transition on the number of degrees of freedom. As expected the transition becomes sharper as the number of degrees of freedom increases. The phase properties of the model are discussed conveniently in terms of Landau functions. In the canonical ensemble the relevant function is the Landau free energy F(Q, T), a function of the order parameter Q and the temperature T. The corresponding function in a microcanonical ensemble is minus the Landau entropy, a function of the order parameter and total energy. These functions can, in general, be calculated from probability distributions which are available from simulations. In both cases stable or metastable phases correspond to valleys in the function; continuous transitions to merging valleys and first-order phase changes to valleys separated by barriers. The N dependence of the Landau functions per degree of freedom is very weak, so that the best criterion for determining the order of a phase transition, which is valid for large and small systems, is the presence or absence of a barrier in the relevant Landau function. The limits of metastability of phases occur at the heads of the valleys in the Landau functions. It is shown that these can be related to the properties of the system in the potential ensemble. The model exhibits a region of negative specific heat (i.e., an S-band in the caloric curve) in the microcanonical ensemble which becomes vanishingly small in the limit of large N. Finally, the relation of these results to other proposed criteria for the limits of metastability of solid phases is discussed.}",

The method, called Extremal Optimization, successively eliminates extremely undesirable components of sub-optimal solutions. Drawing upon models used to simulate far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it complements approximation methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as Simulated Annealing. With only one adjustable parameter, its performance proves competitive with, and often superior to, more elaborate stochastic optimization procedures. We demonstrate it here on two classic hard optimization problems: graph partitioning and the traveling salesman problem."

	Abstract = "{We model the kinetic processes by which globular proteins and other heteropolymers fold to compact states. We perform Monte Carlo dynamics simulations on short self-avoiding copolymer chains on two-dimensional square lattices. The driving force for collapse is the aversion of nonpolar monomers for water. The chain monomers are of two types, H and P; favorable interactions occur among HH contacts. One respect in which this study differs from previous Monte Carlo folding studies is that the chains are sufficiently short that: (i) we can know unequivocally which conformations are at global minima (the ``native{''} states) and which are at local minima of free energy, (ii) we can explore ``pathway space{''} densely to determine the relative probabilities of all the possible pathways, and thus we establish that the model is ergodic and gives the equilibrium distribution in the long-time limit. We find that any individual molecule passes through a wide range of conformational states, often many times. Nevertheless, this meandering is not inconsistent with the observation that proteins fold through specific pathways involving particular sequences of events. Some pathways are strongly favored; i.e., folding is ``cooperative{''} in that a ``nucleating{''} HH contact acts as a constraint that restricts local conformational freedom and speeds the ``zipping up{''} of other contacts nearby. Which pathways are favored depends on the sequence and the solvent. How does a chain fold to its native state so quickly? For these short chains of fixed length, we observe three regimes of folding kinetics. In the ``Levinthal limit,{''} as the HH attraction approaches zero, folding is slow because the molecule searches randomly through the large ensemble of open conformations. In the ``multiple minima{''} limit, when the HH attraction is very strong, folding is also slow because the chain becomes stuck in local minima of wrong compact conformations. However, we find that folding is relatively fast for intermediate HH attraction because the driving force ``directs{''} the molecule toward a small ensemble of compact states, and yet incorrect potential wells are not too deep to slow this process.}",

Nevertheless, protein sequences do fold into unique native states in seconds (the Levinthal paradox). To determine how the Levinthal parades is resolved, we use a lattice Monte Carlo model in which the global minimum (native state) is known. The necessary and sufficient condition for folding in this model is that the native state be a pronounced global minimum on the potential surface. This guarantees thermodynamic stability of the native state at a temperature where the chain does not get trapped in local minima. Folding starts by a rapid collapse from a random-coil state to a random semi-compact globule. It then proceeds by a slow, rate-determining search through the semicompact states to find a transition state from which the chain folds rapidly to the native state. The elements of the folding mechanism that lead to the resolution of the Levinthal parades are the reduced number of conformations that need to be searched in the semicompact globule (similar to 10(10) versus similar to 10(16) for the random coil) and the existence of many (similar to 10(3)) transition states. The results have evolutionary implications and suggest principles for the folding of real proteins.}",

By engineering a protein made of tandem repeats of identical Ig modules, we were able to get explicit AFM data on the unfolding rate of a single protein domain that can be accurately extrapolated to zero force. We compare this with chemical unfolding rates for untethered modules extrapolated to 0 M denaturant. The unfolding rates obtained by the two methods are the same. Furthermore, the transition state for unfolding appears at the same position on the folding pathway when assessed by either method. These results indicate that mechanical unfolding of a single protein by AFM does indeed reflect the same event that is observed in traditional unfolding experiments. The way is now open for the extensive use of AFM to measure folding reactions at the single-molecule level. Single-molecule AFM recordings have the added advantage that they define the reaction coordinate and expose rare unfolding events that cannot be observed in the absence of chemical denaturants.",

H (RNase H) molecules. The protein unfolds in a two-state manner

and refolds through an intermediate that correlates with the transient

molten globule-like intermediate observed in bulk studies. This intermediate

displays unusual mechanical compliance and unfolds at substantially

lower forces than the native state. In a narrow range of forces,

the molecule hops between the unfolded and intermediate states in

real time. Occasionally, hopping was observed to stop as the molecule

crossed the folding barrier directly from the intermediate, demonstrating

that the intermediate is on-pathway. These studies allow us to map

the energy landscape of RNase H.},

A long-standing puzzle has, therefore, been: What forces drive the formation of the specific internal architectures in globular proteins? We find that any self-avoiding flexible polymer molecule will develop large amounts of secondary structure, helices and parallel and antiparallel sheets, as it is driven to increasing compactness by any force of attraction among the chain monomers. Thus structure formation arises from the severity of steric constraints in compact polymers. This steric principle of organization can account for why short helices are stable in globular proteins, why there are parallel and anti-parallel sheets in proteins, and why weakly unfolded proteins have some secondary structure. On this basis, it should be possible to construct copolymers, not necessarily using amino acids, that can collapse to maximum compactness in incompatible solvents and that should then have structural organization resembling that of proteins.",

To assess the quality of structural reaction coordinates in predicting the transition-state ensemble (TSE) of protein folding, we benchmarked the accuracy of four structural reaction coordinates against the kinetic measure P fold, whose value of 0.50 defines the stochastic separatrix for a two-state folding mechanism. For two proteins that fold by a simple two-state mechanism, c-src SH3 and CI-2, the {\^I}¬¶-values of the TSEs predicted by native topology-based reaction coordinates (including Q, the fraction of native contacts) are almost identical to those of the TSE based on P fold, with correlation coefficients of >0.90. For proteins with complex folding mechanisms that have especially broad, asymmetrical free energy barriers such as the designed 3-ankyrin repeating protein (3ANK) or proteins with distinct intermediates such as cyanovirin-N (CV-N), we show that the ensemble of structures with P fold = 0.50 generally does not include the chemically relevant transition states. This weakness of P fold limits its usefulness in protein folding studies. For such systems, elucidating the essential features of folding mechanisms requires using multiple reaction coordinates, although the number is still rather small. At the same time, for simple folding mechanisms, there is no indication of superiority for P fold over structurally chosen and thermodynamically relevant reaction coordinates that correctly measure the degree of nativeness.",

The results reported in this paper have been obtained fora two-dimensional toy-model of aminoacid sequences, whosenative configurations were previously determined byMonte Carlo techniques.The somewhat controversial scenario emerging from the comparison among different thermodynamical indicators is definitely better resolved with the help of a truly dynamical description. In particular,we are able to identify the metastable states visited during the folding process by monitoring the temporal evolution of the `long-range' potentialenergy. Moreover, the resulting dynamical scenario is consistent with the picture arising from a reconstruction of the energy landscape in the vicinity of the global minimum. This suggests that the introduction of efficient `static' indicators too should properly account for the complex `orography' of the landscape.",

We observe both apparent two-state unfolding and several unfolding pathways involving one of three major, mutually exclusive intermediate states. All three major intermediates lack two of seven native [beta]-strands, and share a quite similar extension. The unfolding behavior is found to depend strongly on the pulling conditions. In particular, we observe large variations in the relative frequencies of occurrence for the intermediates. At low constant force or low constant velocity, all three major intermediates occur with a significant frequency. At high constant force or high constant velocity, one of them, with the N- and C-terminal [beta]-strands detached, dominates over the other two. Using the extended Jarzynski equality, we also estimate the equilibrium free-energy landscape, calculated as a function of chain extension. The application of a constant pulling force leads to a free-energy profile with three major local minima. Two of these correspond to the native and fully unfolded states, respectively, whereas the third one can be associated with the major unfolding intermediates."

These transitions often occur under nonequilibrium conditions and are associated with hysteresis effects-features usually taken to preclude the extraction of equilibrium information from the experimental data. But fluctuation theorems allow us to relate the work along nonequilibrium trajectories to thermodynamic free-energy differences. They have been shown to be applicable to single-molecule force measurements and have already provided information on the folding free energy of a RNA hairpin. Here we show that the Crooks fluctuation theorem can be used to determine folding free energies for folding and unfolding processes occurring in weak as well as strong nonequilibrium regimes, thereby providing a test of its validity under such conditions. We use optical tweezers to measure repeatedly the mechanical work associated with the unfolding and refolding of a small RNA hairpin and an RNA three-helix junction. The resultant work distributions are then analysed according to the theorem and allow us to determine the difference in folding free energy between an RNA molecule and a mutant differing only by one base pair, and the thermodynamic stabilizing effect of magnesium ions on the RNA structure.",

At the bottom of the other funnel is the second lowest energy minimum which is an incomplete Mackay icosahedron. We characterize the energy landscape in two ways. First, from a large sample of minima and transition states we construct a disconnectivity graph showing which minima are connected below certain energy thresholds. Second, we compute the free energy as a function of a bond-order parameter. The free energy profile has two minima, one which corresponds to the fcc funnel and the other which at low temperature corresponds to the icosahedral funnel and at higher temperatures to the liquidlike state. These two approaches show that the greater width of the icosahedral funnel, and the greater structural similarity between the icosahedral structures and those associated with the liquidlike state, are the cause of the smaller free energy barrier for entering the icosahedral funnel from the liquidlike state and therefore of the cluster‚Äôs preferential entry into this funnel on relaxation down the energy landscape. Furthermore, the large free energy barrier between the fcc and icosahedral funnels, which is energetic in origin, causes the cluster to be trapped in one of the funnels at low temperature. These results explain in detail the link between the double-funnel energy landscape and the difficulty of global optimization for this cluster. "

Relaxation to the global minimum is easiest for PES‚Äôs consisting of a single funnel (a set of convergent pathways which lead to the global minimum) with low barriers and a significant potential energy gradient towards the global minimum. The presence of additional funnels on the surface can severely reduce the rate of relaxation to the global minimum. Such secondary funnels act most efficiently as kinetic traps when they terminate at a low energy minimum, have a steep potential energy gradient and are wide (i.e., have a large configurational entropy) compared to the primary funnel. Indeed, it is even possible to construct PES's for which the system relaxes to the minimum at the bottom of a secondary funnel rather than the global minimum and then remains in this metastable state over a long time scale. Our results for these model PES‚Äôs are discussed in the context of theoretical and experimental knowledge of the dynamics of proteins, clusters, and glasses. "

Our procedure provides estimates of not only (i) the intrinsic rate coefficient and (ii) the location of the transition state but also (iii) the free energy of activation. By analyzing simulated data, we show that the resulting rates of force-induced rupture are significantly more reliable than those obtained by the widely used approach based on Bell‚Äôs formula. We consider the uniqueness of the extracted kinetic information and suggest guidelines to avoid overinterpretation of experiments. "

	abstract = " The early description of the living cell as a reaction vessel of molecules undergoing random collisions has evolved to a much more interesting picture of a small chemical factory of complex and dynamic molecular structures that carry out specialized functions in a highly-coordinated fashion. Traditional solution biochemistry has had extraordinary success in elucidating molecular structures of the cellular components. The task of capturing the dynamics and the distribution of states of these structures, however, seemed nearly impossible because the activities of the molecules in the solution are asynchronous as the result of their interactions with the surroundings. This situation has changed with the development of single-molecule biophysical methods (1, 2) that permit measurements of the response of macromolecules or individual molecular bonds to external load with the spectacular resolution of subnanometer distances and picoNewton forces, revealing details that are typically lost to ensemble averaging when studied by solution methods. Unprecedented information about the mechanisms that drive biological processes becomes encoded in the resulting wealth of unaveraged data. Recall, however, that these systems are of microscopic dimensions, which puts thermal fluctuations on equal footing with the external deterministic forces. This circumstance, along with the far from equilibrium conditions, makes a quantitative description of the molecular bond properties that can account for observed data a challenging task. The article by Freund in this issue of PNAS (3) offers a theoretical framework that does just that. A novel and concise derivation takes the reader from a very fundamental starting point to a set of analytical results that provide intriguing insights into the response of a molecular bond to an imposed mechanical load.

To interpret the force-dependent lifetimes, we derive a generalization of Bell's formula that is formally exact within the framework of Kramers theory. This result complements the analytical expression for the lifetime that we derived previously for a class of model potentials. We illustrate our procedure by analyzing the nanopore unzipping of DNA hairpins and the unfolding of a protein attached by flexible linkers to an atomic force microscope. Our procedure to transform rupture-force histograms into the force-dependent lifetimes remains valid even when the molecular extension is a poor reaction coordinate and higher-dimensional free-energy surfaces must be considered. In this case the microscopic interpretation of the lifetimes becomes more challenging because the lifetimes can reveal richer, and even nonmonotonic, dependence on the force.",

Here, the performance of STMD is examined in the Lennard-Jones fluid with diverse simulation conditions, and in the coarse-grained, off-lattice BLN 46-mer and 69-mer protein models, exhibiting rugged potential energy landscapes with a high degree of frustration. STMD simulations combined with inherent structure (IS) analysis allow an accurate determination of protein thermodynamics down to very low temperatures, overcoming quasiergodicity, and illuminate the transitions occurring in folding in terms of the energy landscape. It is found that a thermodynamic signature of folding is significantly suppressed by accurate sampling, due to an incoherent contribution from low-lying non-native IS in multifunneled landscapes. It is also shown that preferred accessibility to such IS during the collapse transition is intimately related to misfolding or poor foldability "

Detailed calculations are performed for the 46 bead BLN model, which folds into a four-stranded Œ≤-barrel. Enhanced sampling has allowed determination of 239 199 IS states, believed to encompass nearly all the compact, low-energy states, and of well-averaged thermodynamic quantities at low temperature. The density of states shows distinct lobes for compact and extended states, and entropic barriers for the collapse and local ordering transitions. A two-dimensional scatterplot or density of states clearly shows the multifunnel structure of the energy landscape. The anharmonic vibrational free energy is found to play a crucial role in protein folding. The problem of determining the folding transition in a multifunnel system is discussed, and novel indicators of folding are introduced. A particularly clear picture is obtained through the occupation probabilities, pi, of individual low-lying IS, which become finite below the collapse temperature; it is suggested that poor foldability corresponds to a large {\grqq}misfolding interval‚Äù where the excited state pi>0 exceeds that of the native state p0.

	abstract = " In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics) simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation. Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength, molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast scale of molecular motions. Using results from a simulation of biotin-avidin bonds (Izrailev, S., S. Stepaniants, M. Balsera, Y. Oono, and K. Schulten. 1997. Molecular dynamics study of unbinding of the avidin-biotin complex. Biophys. J., this issue), we describe how Brownian dynamics can help bridge the gap between molecular dynamics and probe tests. "

The behavior of titin as a multistage entropic spring has been shown in atomic force microscope and optical tweezer experiments to partially depend on the reversible unfolding of individual Ig domains. We performed steered molecular dynamics simulations to stretch single titin Ig domains in solution with pulling speeds of 0.5 and 1.0{\AA}/ps. Resulting force-extension profiles exhibit a single dominant peak for each Ig domain unfolding, consistent with the experimentally observed sequential, as opposed to concerted, unfolding of Ig domains under external stretching forces. This force peak can be attributed to an initial burst of backbone hydrogen bonds, which takes place between antiparallel Œ≤-strands A and B and between parallel Œ≤-strands A‚Ä≤ and G. Additional features of the simulations, including the position of the force peak and relative unfolding resistance of different Ig domains, can be related to experimental observations. "

The simulations on different domains for 0.6 nanosecond each reveal two types of protein responses: the first type, arising in certain Œ≤-sandwich domains, exhibits nanosecond unfolding only after a force above 1,500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a wider class of protein domain structures, requires significantly weaker forces for nanosecond unfolding. In the first case, strong forces are needed to concertedly break a set of interstrand hydrogen bonds which protect the domains against unfolding through stretching; in the second case, stretching breaks backbone hydrogen bonds one by one, and does not require strong forces for this purpose.

Previous simulations showed that this barrier is due to the concurrent breaking of six interstrand hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between Œ≤-strands A‚Ä≤ and G that is preceded by the breaking of two to three hydrogen bonds between strands A and B, the latter leading to an unfolding intermediate. The simulation results are supported by {\AA}ngstrom-resolution atomic force microscopy data. Here we perform a structural and energetic analysis of the H-bonds breaking. It is confirmed that H-bonds between strands A and B break rapidly. However, the breaking of the H-bond between strands A‚Ä≤ and G needs to be assisted by fluctuations of water molecules. In nanosecond simulations, water molecules are found to repeatedly interact with the protein backbone atoms, weakening individual interstrand H-bonds until all six A‚Ä≤--G H-bonds break simultaneously under the influence of external stretching forces. Only when those bonds are broken can the generic unfolding take place, which involves hydrophobic interactions of the protein core and exerts weaker resistance against stretching than the key event.

The applied forces are sufficiently large to reduce the overall binding energy enough to yield unbinding within the measurement time. Our study complements earlier work on biotin-streptavidin that employed a much larger harmonic force constant. The simulations reveal a variety of unbinding pathways, the role of key residues contributing to adhesion as well as the spatial range over which avidin binds biotin. In contrast to the previous studies, the calculated rupture forces exceed by far those observed. We demonstrate, in the framework of models expressed in terms of one-dimensional Langevin equations with a schematic binding potential, the associated Smoluchowski equations, and the theory of first passage times, that picosecond to nanosecond simulation of ligand unbinding requires such strong forces that the resulting protein-ligand motion proceeds far from the thermally activated regime of millisecond AFM experiments, and that simulated unbinding cannot be readily extrapolated to the experimentally observed rupture."

	abstract = "A simple micromechanical method has been developed to measure the rupture strength of a molecular-point attachment (focal bond) between two macroscopically smooth membrane capsules. In the procedure, one capsule is prepared with a low density coverage of adhesion molecules, formed as a stiff sphere, and held at fixed position by a micropipette. The second capsule without adhesion molecules is pressurized into a spherical shape with low suction by another pipette. This capsule is maneuvered to initiate point contact at the pole opposite the stiff capsule which leads to formation of a few (or even one) molecular attachments. Then, the deformable capsule is slowly withdrawn by displacement of the pipette. Analysis shows that the end-to-end extension of the capsule provides a direct measure of the force at the point contact and, therefore, the rupture strength when detachment occurs. The range for point forces accessible to this technique depends on the elastic moduli of the membrane, membrane tension, and the size of the capsule. For biological and synthetic vesicle membranes, the range of force lies between 10(-7)-10(-5) dyn (10(-12)-10(-10) N) which is 100-fold less than presently measurable by Atomic Force Microscopy! Here, the approach was used to study the forces required to rupture microscopic attachments between red blood cells formed by a monoclonal antibody to red cell membrane glycophorin, anti-A serum, and a lectin from the snail-helix pomatia. Failure of the attachments appeared to be a stochastic function of the magnitude and duration of the detachment force. We have correlated the statistical behavior observed for rupture with a random process model for failure of small numbers of molecular attachments. The surprising outcome of the measurements and analysis was that the forces deduced for short-time failure of 1-2 molecular attachments were nearly the same for all of the agglutinin, i.e., 1-2 x 10(-6) dyn. Hence, microfluorometric tests were carried out to determine if labeled agglutinins and/or labeled surface molecules were transferred between surfaces after separation of large areas of adhesive contact. The results showed that the attachments failed because receptors were extracted from the membrane.",

	abstract = "Bond dissociation under steadily rising force occurs most frequently at a time governed by the rate of loading (Evans and Ritchie, 1997 Biophys. J. 72:1541-1555). Multiplied by the loading rate, the breakage time specifies the force for most frequent failure (called bond strength) that obeys the same dependence on loading rate. The spectrum of bond strength versus log(loading rate) provides an image of the energy landscape traversed in the course of unbonding. However, when a weak bond is connected to very compliant elements like long polymers, the load applied to the bond does not rise steadily under constant pulling speed. Because of nonsteady loading, the most frequent breakage force can differ significantly from that of a bond loaded at constant rate through stiff linkages. Using generic models for wormlike and freely jointed chains, we have analyzed the kinetic process of failure for a bond loaded by pulling the polymer linkages at constant speed. We find that when linked by either type of polymer chain, a bond is likely to fail at lower force under steady separation than through stiff linkages. Quite unexpectedly, a discontinuous jump can occur in bond strength at slow separation speed in the case of long polymer linkages. We demonstrate that the predictions of strength versus log(loading rate) can rationalize conflicting results obtained recently for unfolding Ig domains along muscle titin with different force techniques.",

This signal reflects the dynamics in the underlying multisubstate on-off kinetic scheme (KS) of the process. The determination of the underlying KS is difficult and sometimes even impossible because of the loss of information in the mapping of the multidimensional KS onto two dimensions. Here we introduce a previously undescribed procedure that efficiently and optimally relates the signal to all equivalent underlying KS. This procedure partitions the space of KS into canonical (unique) forms that can handle any KS and obtains the topology and other details of the canonical form from the data without the need for fitting. Also established are relationships between the data and the topology of the canonical form to the on-off connectivity of a KS. The suggested canonical forms constitute a powerful tool in discriminating between KS. Based on our approach, the upper bound on the information content in two-state trajectories is determined.},

This is pursued for the practical range of behavior in which unbinding occurs diffusively rather than ballistically, building on the classic work of Kramers. For a bond represented by a one-dimensional energy landscape, modified by a second time-dependent energy profile representing applied loading, we present a mathematical analysis showing the dependence of the resistance of the bond-on-bond well shape, general time dependence of the imposed loading, and stiffness of the loading apparatus.

(1997) Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 2690-2693]. The Jarzynski equality provides a powerful free-energy difference estimator from a set of N irreversible experiments and is closely related to free-energy perturbation, a common computational technique for estimating free-energy differences. Despite the many applications of the Jarzynski estimator, its behavior is only poorly understood. In this article we derive the large N limit for the Jarzynski estimator bias, variance, and mean square error that is correct for arbitrary perturbations. We then analyze the properties of the Jarzynski estimator for all N when the probability distribution of work values is Gaussian, as occurs, for example, in the near-equilibrium regime. This allows us to quantitatively compare it to two other free-energy difference estimators: the mean work estimator and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem estimator. We show that, for near-equilibrium switching, the Jarzynski estimator is always superior to the mean work estimator and is even superior to the fluctuation-dissipation estimator for small N. The Jarzynski-estimator bias is shown to be the dominant source of error in many cases. Our expression for the bias is used to develop a bias-corrected Jarzynski free-energy difference estimator in the near-equilibrium regime.",

The former is the temperature above which the structure resembles that of the random coil. Below the first-order folding transition temperature Tf the chain adopts the native conformation corresponding to the four-helix bundle. It is shown that in order to obtain a unique native structure a proper free energy balance between secondary and tertiary interactions is needed. The thermal denaturation starting from the unique native conformation indicates that at least a three-state analysis is required. The intermediates in the equilibrium thermal denaturation are all found to be native-like. The kinetics of refolding starting from an ensemble of denatured states shows that the acquisition of the native conformation takes place via a kinetic partitioning mechanism. A fraction of molecules, phi, reaches the native state by a topology inducing nucleation collapse mechanism, while the remainder (1-phi) follows a complex three-stage multipathway process. We suggest, in accord with our earlier studies, that phi is essentially determined by the intrinsic temperature scales T theta and Tf. Our studies indicate that better design of proteins can be achieved by making T theta as close to Tf as possible. Experimental implications for de novo design of proteins are briefly discussed.",

	abstract = "The kinetics and thermodynamics ofprotein folding is investigated using low friction Langevin simulation ofminimal continuum models ofproteins. We show that the model protein has two characteristic temperatures: (a) T\_theta, at which the chain undergoes a collapse transition from an extended conformation; (6) T\_f (< T\_theta), at which a finite size first-order transition to the folded state takes place. The kinetics of approach to the native state from initially denatured conformations is probed by several novel correlation functions. We find that the overall kinetics of approach to the native conformation occurs via a three-stage multiple pathway mechanism. The initial stage, characterized by a series of local dihedral angle transitions, eventually results in the compaction ofthe protein. Subsequently, the molecule acquires native-like structures during the second stage offolding. The final stage offolding involves activated transitions from one of the native-like structures to the native conformation. Thefirst two stages are characterized by a multiplicity of pathways while relatively few paths are involved in the final stage. A detailed analysis of the dynamics of individual trajectories reveals a novel picture of protein folding. We ind that a fraction ofthe initial population reaches the native conformation without the formation of any detectable intermediates. This pathway is associated with a nucleation mechanism, i.e., once a critical number oftertiary contacts are established then the native state is reached rapidly. The remainingfraction of molecules become trapped in misfolded structures (stabilized by incorrect tertiary contacts). The slow folding involves transitions over barriers from these structures to the native conformation. The theoretical predictions are compared with recent experiments that probe protein folding kinetics by hydrogen exchange labeling technique.",

We present a method of analysing these shifts in mechanism by statistical clustering of trajectories based on the order in which individual contacts dissociate during unfolding.

This state exhibits the mechanical properties of a solid, but shows microscopic structural disorder1,2. A comprehensive understanding of the glassy state is, however, still lacking3. A widespread assumption is that the non-exponential relaxation processes observed in the dynamics of glasses ‚Äî and also in protein dynamics, protein folding and population dynamics ‚Äî are (in common with other manifestations of complex dynamics) strongly influenced by the underlying energy landscape associated with the structural configurations that the system may adopt. But concrete evidence for this in studies of glass formation has been scarce. Here we present such evidence, obtained from computer simulations of a model glass-forming liquid. We demonstrate that the onset of non-exponential relaxation corresponds to a well defined temperature below which the depth of the potential-energy minima explored by the liquid increases with decreasing temperature, and above which it does not. At lower temperatures, we observe a sharp transition when the liquid gets trapped in the deepest accessible energy basin. This transition temperature depends on the cooling rate, in a manner analogous to the experimental glass transition. We also present evidence that the barrier heights separating potential-energy minima sampled by the liquid increase abruptly at a temperature above the glass transition but well below the onset of non-exponential relaxation. This identification of a relationship between static, topographic features of the energy landscape and complex dynamics holds the promise of a clearer, possibly thermodynamic, understanding of the glass transition.

Moreover, by decreasing T, the saddle order vanishes at the same temperature (TMCT) where the inverse diffusivity appears to diverge as a power law. This allows a topological interpretation of TMCT: it marks the transition from a dynamics between basins of saddles (T>TMCT) to a dynamics between basins of minima (T<TMCT). "

We determine that the model for protein G exhibits an early intermediate that precedes the rate-limiting barrier of folding, and which draws together misaligned secondary structure elements that are stabilized by hydrophobic core contacts involving the third P-strand, and presages the later transition state in which the correct strand alignment of these same secondary structure elements is restored. Finally, the validity of the targeted intermediate ensemble for protein G was analyzed by fitting the kinetic data to a two-step first-order reversible reaction, proving that protein G folding involves an on-pathway early intermediate, and should be populated and therefore observable by experiment.}",

The maturation of experimental protein folding has driven the need for more quantitative protein simulations to better understand the balance between sequence details and fold topology. In the past year, we have seen the emergence of more complex minimalist models, ranging from all-atom potentials to coarse-grained bead models in which interactions are replaced or supplemented by more physically motivated potentials. The reduced computational cost at the coarse-grained level of abstraction will potentially enable both folding studies on a genomic scale and systematic application in protein design.",

	abstract = {We suggest, using dynamical simulations of a simple heteropolymer modelling the alpha-carbon sequence in a protein, that generically the folded states of globular proteins correspond to statistically well-defined metastable states. This hypothesis, called the metastability hypothesis, states that there are several free energy minima separated by barriers of various heights such that the folded conformations of a polypeptide chain in each of the minima have similar structural characteristics but have different energies from one another. The calculated structural characteristics, such as bond angle and dihedral angle distribution functions, are assumed to arise from only those configurations belonging to a given minimum. The validity of this hypothesis is illustrated by simulations of a continuum model of a heteropolymer whose low temperature state is a well-defined beta-barrel structure. The simulations were done using a molecular dynamics algorithm (referred to as the "noisy" molecular dynamics method) containing both friction and noise terms. It is shown that for this model there are several distinct metastable minima in which the structural features are similar. Several new methods of analyzing fluctuations in structures belonging to two distinct minima are introduced. The most notable one is a dynamic measure of compactness that can in principle provide the time required for maximal compactness to be achieved. The analysis shows that for a given metastable state in which the protein has a well-defined folded structure the transition to a state of higher compactness occurs very slowly, lending credence to the notion that the system encounters a late barrier in the process of folding to the most compact structure. The examination of the fluctuations in the structures near the unfolding----folding transition temperature indicates that the transition state for the unfolding to folding process occurs closer to the folded state.},

	abstract = { Molecular elasticity is a physicomechanical property that is associated with a select number of polypeptides and proteins, such as the giant muscle protein, titin, and the extracellular matrix protein, tenascin. Both proteins have been the subject of atomic force microscopy (AFM), laser tweezer, and other in vitro methods for examining the effects of force extension on the globular (FNIII/Ig-like) domains that comprise each protein. In this report we present a time-dependent method for simulating AFM force extension and its effect on FNIII/Ig domain unfolding and refolding. This method treats the unfolding and refolding process as a standard three-state protein folding model (U right arrow over left arrow T right arrow over left arrow F, where U is the unfolded state, T is the transition or intermediate state, and F is the fully folded state), and integrates this approach within the wormlike chain (WLC) concept. We simulated the effect of AFM tip extension on a hypothetical titin molecule comprised of 30 globular domains (Ig or FNIII) and 25\% Pro-Glu-Val-Lys (PEVK) content, and analyzed the unfolding and refolding processes as a function of AFM tip extension, extension rate, and variation in PEVK content. In general, we find that the use of a three-state protein-folding kinetic-based model and the implicit inclusion of PEVK domains can accurately reproduce the experimental force-extension curves observed for both titin and tenascin proteins. Furthermore, our simulation data indicate that PEVK domains exhibit extensibility behavior, assist in the unfolding and refolding of FNIII/Ig domains in the titin molecule, and act as a force "buffer" for the FNIII/Ig domains, particularly at low and moderate extension forces. }

	abstract = " Bond dissociation under steadily rising force occurs most frequently at a time governed by the rate of loading (Evans and Ritchie, 1997 Biophys. J. 72:1541--1555). Multiplied by the loading rate, the breakage time specifies the force for most frequent failure (called bond strength) that obeys the same dependence on loading rate. The spectrum of bond strength versus log(loading rate) provides an image of the energy landscape traversed in the course of unbonding. However, when a weak bond is connected to very compliant elements like long polymers, the load applied to the bond does not rise steadily under constant pulling speed. Because of nonsteady loading, the most frequent breakage force can differ significantly from that of a bond loaded at constant rate through stiff linkages. Using generic models for wormlike and freely jointed chains, we have analyzed the kinetic process of failure for a bond loaded by pulling the polymer linkages at constant speed. We find that when linked by either type of polymer chain, a bond is likely to fail at lower force under steady separation than through stiff linkages. Quite unexpectedly, a discontinuous jump can occur in bond strength at slow separation speed in the case of long polymer linkages. We demonstrate that the predictions of strength versus log(loading rate) can rationalize conflicting results obtained recently for unfolding Ig domains along muscle titin with different force techniques.

	abstract = " Recently, it has become possible to unfold a single protein molecule titin, by pulling it with an atomic-force-microscope tip. In this paper, we propose and study a stochastic kinetic model of this unfolding process. Our model assumes that each immunoglobulin domain of titin is held together by six hydrogen bonds. The external force pulls on these bonds and lowers the energy barrier that prevents the hydrogen bond from breaking; this increases the rate of bond breaking and decreases the rate of bond healing. When all six bonds are broken, the domain unfolds. Since the experiment controls the pulling rate, not the force, the latter is calculated from a wormlike chain model for the protein. In the limit of high pulling rate, this kinetic model is solved by a novel simulation method. In the limit of low pulling rate, we develop a quasiequilibrium rate theory, which is tested by simulations. The results are in agreement with the experiments: the distribution of the unfolding force and the dependence of the mean unfolding force on the pulling rate are similar to those measured. The simulations also explain why the work of the force to break bonds is less than the bond energy and why the breaking-force distribution varies from sample to sample. We suggest that one can synthesize polymers that are well described by our model and that they may have unusual mechanical properties. "

We introduce a new approach of comparable complexity to extract more accurate kinetic information about the molecular events from pulling experiments. Our procedure is based on the analysis of a simple stochastic model of pulling with a harmonic spring and encompasses the phenomenological approach, reducing to it in the appropriate limit. Our approach is tested against computer simulations of a multimodule titin model with anharmonic linkers and then an illustrative application is made to the forced unfolding of I27 subunits of the protein titin. Our procedure to extract kinetic information from pulling experiments is simple to implement and should prove useful in the analysis of experiments on a variety of systems."

We illustrate the complexity of the folding kinetics and generic aspects of the collapse of RNA and proteins upon force quench by using simulations of an RNA hairpin and theory based on the de Gennes model for homopolymer collapse. The folding time, tau(F), depends asymmetrically on deltaf(S) = f (S) - f (m) and deltaf (Q) = f (m) - f (Q) where f (S) (f (Q)) is the stretch (quench) force and f (m) is the transition midforce of the RNA hairpin. In accord with experiments, the relaxation kinetics of the molecular extension, R(t), occurs in three stages: A rapid initial decrease in the extension is followed by a plateau and finally, an abrupt reduction in R(t) occurs as the native state is approached. The duration of the plateau increases as lambda = tau (Q)/tau (F) decreases (where tau (Q) is the time in which the force is reduced from f (S) to f (Q)). Variations in the mechanisms of force-quench relaxation as lambda is altered are reflected in the experimentally measurable time-dependent entropy, which is computed directly from the folding trajectories. An analytical solution of the de Gennes model under tension reproduces the multistage stage kinetics in R(t). The prediction that the initial stages of collapse should also be a generic feature of polymers is validated by simulation of the kinetics of toroid (globule) formation in semiflexible (flexible) homopolymers in poor solvents upon quenching the force from a fully stretched state. Our findings give a unified explanation for multiple disparate experimental observations of protein folding.",

In order to obtain reliable estimates of the energy landscape characteristics it is necessary to combine the experimental measurements (the force--extension curves, the mechanical unfolding trajectories, force or loading rate dependent unfolding rates) with sound theoretical models and simulations. Here, we show how by using temperature as a variable in mechanical unfolding of biomolecules in laser optical tweezer or AFM experiments the roughness of the energy landscape can be measured without making any assumptions about the underlying reaction coordinate. The efficacy of the formalism is illustrated by reviewing experimental results that have directly measured roughness in a protein--protein complex. The roughness model can also be used to interpret experiments on forced unfolding of proteins in which temperature is varied. Estimates of other aspects of the energy landscape such as free energy barriers or the transition state (TS) locations could depend on the precise model used to analyse the experimental data. We illustrate the inherent difficulties in obtaining the transition state location from loading rate or force dependent unfolding rates. Because the transition state moves as the force or the loading rate is varied it is in general difficult to invert the experimental data unless the curvature at the top of the one dimensional free energy profile is large, i.e. the barrier is sharp. The independence of the TS location of the force holds good only for brittle or hard biomolecules whereas the TS location changes considerably if the molecule is soft or plastic. We also comment on the usefulness of extension of the molecule as a surrogate reaction coordinate especially in the context of force-quench refolding of proteins and RNA.",

We find that i) the number of configurations accessible from a given suboptimal tour grows exponentially with the energy lid, ii) the density of states within the pocket also shows exponential growth, iii) the low-temperature dynamical behaviour is characterized by a sequence of local equilibrations in increasingly larger regions of phase space and finally iv) the propagator decays algebraically with a temperature-dependent exponent.

Such arguments do not rule out the possible existence of an algorithm, more selective than exhaustive search, that is efficient and exact. (An efficient algorithm is one that is guaranteed, for all possible inputs, to run in time bounded by a function polynomial in the problem size. An intractable problem is one for which no efficient algorithm exists.) Questions regarding the possible intractability of problems are often best answered using the theory of NP-completeness. In this treatment we show the NP-hardness of two typical mathematical statements of empirical potential energy function minimization of macromolecules. Unless all NP-complete problems can be solved efficiently, these results imply that a function minimization algorithm can be efficient for protein structure prediction only if it exploits protein-specific properties that prohibit the simple geometric constructions that we use in our proofs. Analysis of further mathematical statements of molecular structure prediction could constitute a systematic methodology for identifying sources of complexity in protein folding, and for guiding development of predictive algorithms.}",

	Abstract = "{The folding of several model proteins is studied using three optimization algorithms which are based on the simulated annealing of an approximation to the classical density distribution. These methods are derived from the approximate solution of equations of motion for the time or temperature evolution of the density distribution. Therefore, it is of interest to analyze not only the resulting lowest energy molecular conformations but also the folding mechanism followed during the annealing runs. The results are compared with classical simulated annealing based on molecular dynamics and the diffusion equation method of Scheraga and coworkers. The model proteins studied are 22-mers and a 46-mer based on a three-letter code used by Honeycutt and Thirumalai. The potential models the basic properties of attractive interactions between hydrophobic residues, to encourage the formation of a hydrophobic core, and the propensity of hydrophilic residues to be found at the protein surface. Analysis of the thermodynamically dominant structures during annealing reveals a collapse transition at high temperature followed by a strong folding transition to the native state at lower temperatures. This general mechanism has been seen previously in simulations of similar model proteins and predicted on the basis of mean field theories of heteropolymers. We find that the probability of success in finding the set of lowest energy native states is strongly correlated with the energy separation between the native (and native-like) and non-native states. Our optimization algorithms are effective in finding those low-energy structures which correspond to the global energy minimum fold. The results indicate that dynamical phase space simulated annealing methods may have an advantage over configuration space based search for complex fold topologies.}",

	abstract = {Folding and unfolding are fundamental biological processes in cell and are important for the biological functions of proteins. Characterizing the folding and unfolding kinetics of proteins is important for understanding the energetic landscape leading to the active native conformations of these molecules. However, the thermal or chemical-induced unfolding of many proteins is irreversible in vitro, precluding characterization of the folding kinetics of such proteins, just as it is impossible to "un-boil" an egg. Irreversible unfolding often manifests as irreversible aggregation of unfolded polypeptide chains, which typically occurs between denatured protein molecules in response to the exposure of hydrophobic residues to solvent. An example of such a protein where thermal denaturation results in irreversible aggregation is the Œ≤-1,4 endoxylanase from Bacillus circulans (BCX). Here, we report the use of single-molecule atomic force microscopy to directly measure the folding kinetics of BCX in vitro. By mechanically unfolding BCX, we essentially allowed only one unfolded molecule to exist in solution at a given time, effectively eliminating the possibility for aggregation. We found that BCX can readily refold back to the native state, allowing us to measure its folding kinetics for the first time. Our results demonstrate that single-molecule force-spectroscopy-based methods can adequately tackle the challenge of "un-boiling eggs", providing a general methodology to characterize the folding kinetics of many proteins that suffer from irreversible denaturation and thus cannot be characterized using traditional equilibrium methodologies.}

Here we use liquid-phase density functional theory calculations to find transition states and intermediates on the free-energy surfaces of four base-initiated alpha,beta-eliminations of acetoxy and mesyloxy esters and their analogous thioesters. The geometries, free energies, and charge distributions of these structures support a stepwise irreversible first-order elimination from a conjugate base (E1cB(I)) mechanism with acetoxy ester 3, acetoxy thioester 4, and mesyloxy thioester 6. However, mesyloxy ester 5, which has an excellent nucleofuge and a less-acidic proton, follows a concerted but asynchronous E2 mechanism with an E1cB-like transition state. The anti transition state is more favorable than the syn one, even for the poorer nucleofuge and more-acidic thioesters. The article includes a general scheme for describing liquid-phase reactions in terms of free-energy surfaces.",

	abstract = {Single-molecule experiments in which proteins are unfolded by applying mechanical stretching forces generally force unfolding to proceed along a reaction coordinate that is different from that in chemical or thermal denaturation. Here we simulate the mechanical unfolding and refolding of a minimalist off-lattice model of the protein ubiquitin to explore in detail the slice of the multidimensional free-energy landscape that is accessible via mechanical pulling experiments. We find that while the free-energy profile along typical "chemical" reaction coordinates may exhibit two minima, corresponding to the native and denatured states, the free energy G(z) is typically a monotonic function of the mechanical coordinate z equal to the protein extension. Application of a stretching force along z tilts the free-energy landscape resulting in a bistable (or multistable) free energy G(z)-fz probed in mechanical unfolding experiments. We construct a two-dimensional free-energy surface as a function of both chemical and mechanical reaction coordinates and examine the coupling between the two. We further study the refolding trajectories after the protein has been prestretched by a large force, as well as the mechanical unfolding trajectories in the presence of a large stretching force. We demonstrate that the stretching forces required to destabilize the native state thermodynamically are larger than those expected on the basis of previous experimental estimates of G(z). This finding is consistent with the recent experimental studies, indicating that proteins may refold even in the presence of a substantial stretching force. Finally, we show that for certain temperatures the free energy of a polyprotein chain consisting of multiple domains is a linear function of the chain extension. We propose that the recently observed "slow phase" in the refolding of proteins under mechanical tension may be viewed as downhill diffusion in such a linear potential.},

	abstract = "We use a three-dimensional lattice model of proteins to investigate systematically the global properties of the polypeptide chains that determine the folding to the native conformation starting from an ensemble of denatured conformations. In the coarse-grained description, the polypeptide chain is modeled as a heteropolymer consisting of N beads confined to the vertices of a simple cubic lattice. The interactions between the beads are taken from a random gaussian distribution of energies, with a mean value B0 < 0 that corresponds to the overall average hydrophobic interaction energy. We studied 56 sequences all with a unique ground state (native conformation) covering two values of N (15 and 27) and two values of B0. The smaller value of magnitude of B0 was chosen so that the average fraction of hydrophobic residues corresponds to that found in natural proteins. The higher value of magnitude of B0 was selected with the expectation that only the fully compact conformations would contribute to the thermodynamic behavior. For N = 15 the entire conformation space (compact as well as noncompact structures) can be exhaustively enumerated so that the thermodynamic properties can be exactly computed at all temperatures. The thermodynamic properties for the 27-mer chain were calculated using the slow cooling technique together with standard Monte Carlo simulations. The kinetics of approach to the native state for all the sequences was obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. For all sequences we find that there are two intrinsic characteristic temperatures, namely, T theta and Tf. At the temperature T theta the polypeptide chain makes a transition to a collapsed structure, while at Tf the chain undergoes a transition to the native conformation. We show that foldability of sequences can be characterized entirely in terms of these two temperatures. It is shown that fast folding sequences have small values of sigma = (T theta - Tf)/T theta whereas slow folders have larger values of sigma (the range of sigma is 0 < sigma < 1). The calculated values of the folding times correlate extremely well with sigma. An increase in sigma from 0.1 to 0.7 can result in an increase of 5-6 orders of magnitudes in folding times. In contrast, we demonstrate that there is no useful correlation between folding times and the energy gap between the native conformation and the first excited state at any N for any value of B0. In particular, in the parameter space of the model, many sequences with varying energy gaps, all with roughly the same folding time, can be easily engineered. Folding sequences in this model, therefore, can be classified based solely on the value of sigma. Fast folders have small values of sigma (typically less than about 0.1), moderate folders have values of sigma in the approximate range between 0.1 and 0.6, while for slow folders sigma exceeds 0.6. The precise boundary between these categories depends crucially on N and on the model. The range of sigma for fast folders decreases with the length of the chain. At temperatures close to Tf fast folders reach the native conformation via a native conformation nucleation collapse mechanism without forming any detectable intermediates, whereas only a fraction of molecule phi (T) reaches the native conformation by this process for moderate folders. The remaining fraction reaches the native state via three-stage multipathway process. For slow folders phi (T) is close to zero at all temperatures. The simultaneous requirement of native state stability and kinetic accessibility can be achieved at high enough temperatures for those sequences with small values of sigma. The utility of these results for de novo design of proteins is briefly discussed.",

The stretching rates of individual molecules show great variations reflecting the heterogeneity of force-induced unfolding pathways. The approach to the stretched state occurs in a stepwise {\grqq}quantized‚Äù manner. Unfolding dynamics and forces required to stretch proteins depend sensitively on topology. The unfolding rates increase exponentially with force f till an optimum value, which is determined by the barrier to unfolding when f = 0.

Near the folding transition temperature, the folding rate kF scales as kF exp(‚àíc RCO N0.6) where RCO and N are the relative contact order and number of residues, respectively. Here the topology RCO dependence of the rates is close to that found experimentally (kF exp(‚àíc RCO)), while the chain length N dependence is in harmony with the predicted scaling property (kF exp(‚àíc N2/3)). Thus, this may provides a unified scaling law in folding rates at the transition temperature, kF exp(‚àíc RCO N2/3). The degree of residual structure in the denatured state is highly correlated with RCO, namely, proteins with smaller RCO tend to have more ordered structure in the denatured state. This is consistent with the observation that many helical proteins such as myoglobin and protein A, have partial helices, in the denatured states. The characteristics of the transition state ensemble calculated by the current model, which uses native topology but not sequence specific information, are consistent with experimental œÜ-value data for about half of proteins.

The model includes both repulsive (excluded volume) and attractive segment--segment interactions. It is shown that the polymers group into two classes, ‚Äò‚Äòflexible‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòstiff.‚Äô‚Äô The flexible polymers exhibit decreasing chain dimensions as the temperature decreases with a gradual collapse from a loose random coil, high temperature state to a dense random coil, low temperature state. The stiffer polymers, on the other hand, exhibit increasing chain dimensions with decreasing temperature until at a critical temperature there is a sudden collapse to an ordered high density, low temperature state. This difference is due to the relative strength of the segment--segment attractive interactions compared to the energetic preference for a trans conformational state over a gauche state. When the attractive interaction is relatively strong (flexible case) the polymer starts to collapse before rotational degrees of freedom freeze out, leading to a disordered dense state. When the attractive interaction is relatively weak (stiff case) the polymer starts to freeze out rotational degrees of freedom before it finally collapses to a highly ordered dense state. "

The latter Is not a quasi-Newton-type algorithm, which is the only class of geometry optimization methods that has been combined with DIIS. With this new combination, we obtain a factor of two speedup due to DIIS, similar to the DIlS-related speedup achieved in other methods including quasi-Newton geometry optimization and self-consistent field iterations. We also demonstrate that DIIS is useful even in cases where optimization is started far from the quadratic region of the TS, provided that only one previous iteration is used in the DIIS expansion. We compare the performance of the new ridge-DLTS method to that of the TS algorithm utilized in GAUSSIAN 92. We find that the computational cost of the former is similar (when both methods converge) to that of the latter. The examples considered in the paper include a novel TS found for an isomerization of a cluster of six Na atoms. Locating such a TS poses a known problem for second-derivatives-based algorithms that fail on very flat potential energy surfaces. Thus, the gradient-based ridge-DIIS method is the only TS;search method that is robust, does not need second derivatives and/or an initial guess for the TS geometry, and whose performance matches or exceeds that of a second-derivatives-based algorithm.

It is tested on alanine dipeptide (AD) with four minima and eight transition states and applied to a flexible molecule, isobutyryl--(ala)3--NH--methyl (IAN), the shortest peptide which can form a full helical turn. There were found 138 minima and 490 transition states for IAN. It is shown that the connectivity network between the minima is very dilute and composed of transitions localized on one or two neighboring amide units. Most of the transitions involve one or two dihedral flips. The reaction coordinate from an extended chain conformation to a helix follows a sequence of nonoverlapping rotations around bonds. The rotations along the reaction coordinates are such that the hard repulsions between different atoms are minimized but at the same time the hydrogen bonding and the electrostatic interactions are maximized. A melting‚Äêlike transition which is associated with the sudden opening of a large number of hopping channels is identified between minima at approximately 5 kcal/mol above the lowest energy minimum. The calculated minima and transition states are used to construct a master equation for the two molecules. The vibrational spectrum of the N--H stretch as a function of time and temperature is finally calculated. It is demonstrated that time‚Äêdependent lineshape analysis can be a useful tool to investigate the properties of the large number of minima and the intervening transitions. "

The local minima often disappear with volume changes, after which the system becomes mechanically unstable and subsequently relaxes to a different, unrelated local minimum. Several characteristics of the potential energy surface are monitored as the volume is changed, including normal mode frequencies, barrier heights, and orientations and distances between the local minima and transition states. These characteristics are used to elucidate the disappearance of the local minimum and the ensuing relaxation to a different local minimum. The disappearance of an energy minimum becomes more probable as the number of atoms in the system increases. Implications of these results are discussed with regard to pressure-induced structural rearrangements and equation-of-state properties of glasses. "

Numerically locating these potential energy minima in realistic models for various substances is often a very demanding task. A class of many‚Äêbody systems, ‚Äò‚Äòdynamical lattice gases,‚Äô‚Äô is introduced for which the steepest‚Äêdescent quenching is particularly simple. The resulting packings place particles on sites of a regular array, the distribution of energies of those packings can be obtained from the solution of a related Ising model, and transition states between interconvertible packings are trivial to locate. Some elementary analytical results have been obtained for vibrational free energies of the packings. Some versions of these models, notably the quarter‚Äêfilled face‚Äêcentered‚Äêcubic case, are well suited for study of liquid‚Äêphase supercooling and formation of low‚Äêtemperature amorphous solids "

When the timescale for thermally activated processes is longer than the timescale of stretching, the disappearances of energy barriers provide the mechanism for protein unfolding. When the timescale for thermally activated processes is shorter than the timescale of stretching, the landscape distortions influence the stretching process by changing the number and types of energy minima in which the system can exist.",

Although Monte Carlo simulations provide insights into the long-time processes involved in protein folding, these simulations cannot systematically chart the conformational energy surface that enables folding. By assuming that protein folding occurs after chain collapse, a kinetic map of important pathways on this surface is constructed through the use of an analytical theory of probability flow. Convergent kinetic pathways, or "folding funnels," guide folding to a unique, stable, native conformation. Solution of the probability flow equations is facilitated by limiting treatment to diffusion between geometrically similar collapsed conformers. Similarity is measured in terms of a reconfigurational distance. Two specific amino acid sequences are deemed foldable and nonfoldable because one gives rise to a single, large folding funnel leading to a native conformation and the other has multiple pathways leading to several stable conformers. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that folding funnel calculations accurately predict the fact of and the pathways involved in folding-specific sequences. The existence of folding funnels for specific sequences suggests that geometrically related families of stable, collapsed conformers fulfill kinetic and thermodynamic requirements of protein folding.},

We employ an iterative, consensus-based scheme to cluster the 725 nonbonded distances between the hydrophobic beads using, in tandem, Ward‚Äôs method for hierarchical clustering and k-means partitional clustering. We also independently analyze the same data using computer-automated histogram filtering, a technology designed to cluster high-dimensional data, without the tedium and subjectivity required by our iterative implementation of the two classical clustering methods. The memberships of low-energy clusters obtained from both classical clustering and automated histogram filtering approaches are remarkably similar. Nonbonded distance constraints are derived from these clusters and from small sets of the original unclustered conformations obtained by simulated annealing. Employing a distance geometry approach, we efficiently generate novel, low-energy conformations from each set of distance constraints, including the apparent native structure, up to 40 times faster than by doing additional simulated annealing runs. Over 33 000 unique locally optimized conformations are generated in total, substantially augmenting the number of low-energy states located by the original simulated annealing runs. "

This field has now matured beyond the phenomenological with exciting recent developments, particularly with regards to research into biological questions. For example, detailed mechanistic studies have suggested how mechanically active proteins perform their functions. Also, in vitro forced unfolding has been compared with in vivo protein import and degradation. Additionally, investigations have been carried out that probe the relationship between protein structure and response to applied force, an area that has benefited significantly from synergy between experiments and simulations. Finally, recent technological developments offer exciting new avenues for experimental studies. "

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.",

We show how to apply this relation in order to evaluate the free energy landscapes of simple systems. These systems are manipulated by varying the external field coupled with a systems' internal characteristic variable. Two different manipulation protocols are considered here: in the first case the external field is a linear function of time; in the second case it is a periodic function of time. While for simple mean field systems both the linear protocol and the oscillatory protocol provide reliable estimates of the free energy landscape, for a simple model of a homopolymer the oscillatory protocol turns out to be not reliable for this purpose. We then discuss the possibility of application of the method presented here to evaluate the free energy landscapes of real systems, and the practical limitations that one can face in the realization of an experimental set-up."

For a wide range of forces, the unfolding dynamics can be treated as one- dimensional diffusion, parametrized in terms of the end-to-end distance. In particular, the escape times can be evaluated as first passage times for a Brownian particle moving on the protein free-energy landscape, using the Smoluchowski equation. At strong forces, the unfolding process can be viewed as a diffusive drift away from the native state, while at weak forces thermal activation is the relevant mechanism. An escape-time analysis within this approach reveals a crossover from an exponential to an inverse Gaussian escape-time distribution upon passing from weak to strong forces. Moreover, a single expression valid at weak and strong forces can be devised both for the average unfolding time as well as for the corresponding variance. The analysis offers a possible explanation of recent experimental findings for the proteins ddFLN4 and ubiquitin.",

	abstract = "Single-molecule manipulation techniques reveal that stretching unravels individually folded domains in the muscle protein titin and the extracellular matrix protein tenascin. These elastic proteins contain tandem repeats of folded domains with Œ≤-sandwich architecture. Herein, we propose by stretching two model sequences (S1 and S2) with four-stranded Œ≤-barrel topology that unfolding forces and pathways in folded domains can be predicted by using only the structure of the native state. Thermal refolding of S1 and S2 in the absence of force proceeds in an all-or-none fashion. In contrast, phase diagrams in the force-temperature (f,T) plane and steered Langevin dynamics studies of these sequences, which differ in the native registry of the strands, show that S1 unfolds in an allor-none fashion, whereas unfolding of S2 occurs via an obligatory intermediate. Force-induced unfolding is determined by the native topology. After proving that the simulation results for S1 and S2 can be calculated by using native topology alone, we predict the order of unfolding events in Ig domain (Ig27) and two fibronectin III type domains (9FnIII and 10FnIII). The calculated unfolding pathways for these proteins, the location of the transition states, and the pulling speed dependence of the unfolding forces reflect the differences in the way the strands are arranged in the native states. We also predict the mechanisms of force-induced unfolding of the coiled-coil spectrin (a three-helix bundle protein) for all 20 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Our approach suggests a natural way to measure the phase diagram in the (f,C) plane, where C is the concentration of denaturants.",

	abstract = " RNA folding is a kinetic process governed by the competition of a large number of structures stabilized by the transient formation of base pairs that may induce complex folding pathways and the formation of misfolded structures. Despite its importance in modern biophysics, the current understanding of RNA folding kinetics is limited by the complex interplay between the weak base pair interactions that stabilize the native structure and the disordering effect of thermal forces. The possibility of mechanically pulling individual molecules offers a new perspective to understand the folding of nucleic acids. Here we investigate the folding and misfolding mechanism in RNA secondary structures pulled by mechanical forces. We introduce a model based on the identification of the minimal set of structures that reproduce the patterns of force-extension curves obtained in single molecule experiments. The model requires only two fitting parameters: the attempt frequency at the level of individual base pairs and a parameter associated to a free-energy correction that accounts for the configurational entropy of an exponentially large number of neglected secondary structures. We apply the model to interpret results recently obtained in pulling experiments in the three-helix junction S15 RNA molecule (RNAS15). We show that RNAS15 undergoes force-induced misfolding where force favors the formation of a stable non-native hairpin. The model reproduces the pattern of unfolding and refolding force-extension curves, the distribution of breakage forces, and the misfolding probability obtained in the experiments. "

We apply path thermodynamics to derive analytical expressions for the average dissipated work and the average hopping number in two-state systems.

In this article we investigate a minimal model for the experimental setup which includes an RNA molecule connected to two polymers (handles) and a bead trapped in the optical potential and attached to one of the handles. We start by considering the case of small single-domain RNA molecules, which unfold in a cooperative way. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimental results and allows us to investigate the influence of the bead and handles on the unfolding reaction. A main ingredient of the model is to consider the appropriate statistical ensemble and the corresponding thermodynamic potential describing thermal fluctuations in the system. We then investigate several questions relevant to extract thermodynamic information from experimental data. The kinetics of unfolding is also studied by introducing a dynamical model. Finally, we apply the model to the more general problem of a multidomain RNA molecule with Mg(2+) tertiary contacts that unfolds in a sequential way.",

In a small range of forces, an RNA molecule can hop between the folded and the unfolded state with force-dependent kinetic rates. Here, we introduce a mesoscopic model to analyze the hopping kinetics of RNA hairpins in an optical tweezers setup. The model includes different elements of the experimental setup (beads, handles, and RNA sequence) and limitations of the instrument (time lag of the force-feedback mechanism and finite bandwidth of data acquisition). We investigated the influence of the instrument on the measured hopping rates. Results from the model are in good agreement with the experiments reported in the companion article. The comparison between theory and experiments allowed us to infer the values of the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA hairpin alone and to search for the optimal experimental conditions to do the measurements. We conclude that the longest handles and softest traps that allow detection of the folding/unfolding signal (handles approximately 5-10 Kbp and traps approximately 0.03 pN/nm) represent the best conditions to obtain the intrinsic molecular rates.

	abstract = " The modular protein titin, which is responsible for the passive elasticity of muscle, is subjected to stretching forces. Previous work on the experimental elongation of single titin molecules has suggested that force causes consecutive unfolding of each domain in an all-or-none fashion. To avoid problems associated with the heterogeneity of the modular, naturally occurring titin, we engineered single proteins to have multiple copies of single immunoglobulin domains of human cardiac titin. Here we report the elongation of these molecules using the atomic force microscope. We find an abrupt extension of each domain by approximately 7 A before the first unfolding event. This fast initial extension before a full unfolding event produces a reversible 'unfolding intermediate' Steered molecular dynamics simulations show that the rupture of a pair of hydrogen bonds near the amino terminus of the protein domain causes an extension of about 6 A, which is in good agreement with our observations. Disruption of these hydrogen bonds by site-directed mutagenesis eliminates the unfolding intermediate. The unfolding intermediate extends titin domains by approximately 15\% of their slack length, and is therefore likely to be an important previously unrecognized component of titin elasticity. "

Using a dynamic voltage control method, the entry rate of polynucleotides into the pore and the voltage pattern applied to induce hairpin unzipping are independently set. Thus, hundreds of unzipping events can be tested in a short period of time (few minutes), independently of the unzipping voltage amplitude. Because our method does not entail the physical coupling of the molecules under test to a force transducer, very high throughput can be achieved. We used our method to study DNA unzipping kinetics at small forces, which have not been accessed before. We find that in this regime the static unzipping times decrease exponentially with voltage with a characteristic slope that is independent of the duplex region sequence, and that the intercept depends strongly on the duplex region energy. We also present the first nanopore dynamic force measurements (time varying force). Our results are in agreement with the approximately logV dependence at high V (where V is the loading rate) observed by other methods. The extension of these measurements to lower loading rates reveals a much weaker dependence on V.",

Exact solutions can then be given for the escape rate from single- and double-well potentials. This general scheme can be naturally extended to include quantum penetration through a semiclassical barrier and the effect of quantum noise. Finally, we consider the Brownian motion in titled washboard potential using Josephson junctions as an illustrative example. In that context we calculate (i) fluctuation-induced voltage-current characteristics; (ii) the lifetime of a zero-voltage state; (iii) the lifetime of the running state; (iv) partial probabilities of the phase jumps by 2œÄn (n is an integer); and (v) retrapping current distribution in both the classical and quantum regimes.

	abstract = "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to measure the strength of bonds between biological receptor molecules and their ligands. But for weak noncovalent bonds, a dynamic spectrum of bond strengths is predicted as the loading rate is altered, with the measured strength being governed by the prominent barriers traversed in the energy landscape along the force-driven bond-dissociation pathway. In other words, the pioneering early AFM measurements represent only a single point in a continuous spectrum of bond strengths, because theory predicts that these will depend on the rate at which the load is applied. Here we report the strength spectra for the bonds between streptavidin (or avidin) and biotins-the prototype of receptor-ligand interactions used in earlier AFM studies, and which have been modelled by molecular dynamics. We have probed bond formation over six orders of magnitude in loading rate, and find that the bond survival time diminished from about 1 min to 0.001 s with increasing loading rate over this range. The bond strength, meanwhile, increased from about 5 pN to 170 pN. Thus, although they are among the strongest noncovalent linkages in biology (affinity of 10(13) to 10(15) M(-1)), these bonds in fact appear strong or weak depending on how fast they are loaded. We are also able to relate the activation barriers derived from our strength spectra to the shape of the energy landscape derived from simulations of the biotin-avidin complex.",

We find that the change from one era to the next corresponds to a fold catastrophe, during the Kasner shifts the potential is an implicit function form whereas, as the anisotropy dissipates, the mixmaster potential must become a Morse 0-saddle. We compare and contrast our results to many known works on the mixmaster problem and indicate how extensions could be achieved. Further exploitation of this formulation may lead to a clearer understanding of the global mixmaster dynamics."

	abstract = { New geometry optimization techniques are introduced for characterizing local minima, transition states, and pathways corresponding to enthalpy surfaces at constant pressure. Results are obtained for comparison with the potential energy surfaces of model glass formers studied in previous work. The constant pressure condition, where the the box lengths of the simulation cell vary, makes the enthalpy surface less rugged than the potential energy surface corresponding to the same mean density. Analysis of barrier heights as a function of pressure provides insight into transport and relaxation processes. Elementary rearrangements can be separated into "diffusive" and "nondiffusive" processes, where the former involve changes in the nearest-neighbor coordination of at least one atom, and the latter do not. With increasing pressure the barrier heights for cage-breaking rearrangements rise, while those for cage-preserving rearrangements appear relatively unchanged. The {\grqq}strong‚Äù or {\grqq}fragile‚Äù character of the system can therefore change with pressure because the barriers encountered vary in a systematic fashion. The geometric mean normal mode frequencies of a binary Lennard-Jones system decrease with increasing potential energy for constant pressure, rather than increase as they do at constant volume, in agreement with a simple model. }

This procedure can lead to error if the activated complex is chosen to have such a high degree of symmetry that it can form more than one form of the reactants or products. It is shown from a consideration of multi-dimensional potential-energy surfaces that a single activated complex cannot exist at the intersection of two valleys; three valleys, for example, will give rise to three separate activated states, each of which represents the lowest pass between a pair of valleys.

	abstract = "In the framework of single-molecule pulling experiments, the system is typically driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent external potential V(t) acting on a collective coordinate such that the total Hamiltonian is the sum of V(t) and the Hamiltonian in the absence of external perturbation. Nonequilibrium work theorems such as Jarzynski equality and Crooks fluctuation theorem have been devised to recover free energy differences between states of this extended system. However, one is often more interested in the potential of mean force of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, i.e., in the effective potential dictating the equilibrium distribution of the collective coordinate in the absence of the external potential. In this respect, Hummer and Szabo proposed an algorithm to estimate the desired free energy differences when pulling experiments are performed in only one direction of the process ( Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001, 98, 3658 ). In this paper, we present a potential of mean force estimator of the unperturbed system that exploits the work measured in both forward and backward directions of the process. The method is based on the reweighting technique of Hummer and Szabo and on the Bennett acceptance ratio. Using Brownian-dynamics simulations on a double-well free energy surface, we show that the estimator works satisfactorily in any pulling situation, from nearly equilibrium to strongly dissipative regimes. The method is also applied to the unfolding/refolding process of decaalanine, a system vastly used to illustrate and to test nonequilibrium methodologies. A thorough comparative analysis with another bidirectional potential of mean force estimator ( Minh, D. D. L.; Adib, A. B. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008, 100, 180602 ) is also presented. The proposed approach is well-suited to recover free energy profiles from single-molecule bidirectional-pulling experiments such as those performed by optical tweezers or atomic force microscopes.",

Good folding sequences have a landscape that resembles a rough funnel where the energy bias towards the native state is larger than its ruggedness. Such a landscape leads not only to fast folding and stable native conformations but, more importantly, to sequences that are robust to variations in the protein environment and to sequence mutations. In this paper, an off-lattice model of sequences that fold into a Œ≤-barrel native structure is used to describe a framework that can quantitatively distinguish good and bad folders. The two sequences analyzed have the same native structure, but one of them is minimally frustrated whereas the other one exhibits a high degree of frustration. "

We explain the theoretical framework that underlies this method and use it to clarify the connection between the experimentally determined Œ¶ value, a quantity determined by the ratio of rate and stability changes due to point mutations, and the average structure of the transition state ensemble. To determine the accuracy of this thermodynamic approach, we apply it to minimalist protein models and compare these results with the ones obtained by using the standard experimental procedure for determining Œ¶ values. We show that the accuracy of both methods depends sensitively on the amount of frustration. In particular, the results are similar when applied to models with minimal amounts of frustration, characteristic of rapid-folding, single-domain globular proteins.",

It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural intermediates. It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated heteropolymer with a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems, polymers, and phase transitions of finite systems. We review here its analytical background and contrast the phenomena in homopolymers, random heteropolymers, and protein-like heteropolymers that are kinetically and thermodynamically capable of folding. The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is discussed. The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure prediction.",

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Energy landscape theory predicts that the folding funnel for a small fast-folding alpha-helical protein will have a transition state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the position of the transition state along an appropriate reaction coordinate can be obtained from linear free energy relationships observed for folding and unfolding rate constants as a function of denaturant concentration. The experimental results of Huang and Oas for lambda repressor, Fersht and collaborators for C12, and Gray and collaborators for cytochrome c indicate a free energy barrier midway between the folded and unfolded regions. This barrier arises from an entropic bottleneck for the folding process. RESULTS: In keeping with the experimental results, lattice simulations based on the folding funnel description show that the transition state is not just a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of configurations that can be described by specific values of one or a few order parameters (e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of this transition state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations and from atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko and Brooks indicates a broad distribution for native contact participation in the transition state ensemble centered around 50\%. Importantly, however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble does include some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the experiments, which have been termed by others a folding nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Linear free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy of the transition state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction coordinate based on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck may be thought of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different native contacts will have different degrees of participation. The agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions provides strong support for the landscape analysis.",

This construct also shows increased coil aggregation during refolding, and a 14-mer peptide encompassing the engineered sequence forms fibrils. Mutational analysis shows that intermolecular association is linked to the overall hydrophobicity of the sticky sequence and implies the existence of "structural gatekeepers" in the wild-type protein, that is, charged side chains that prevent aggregation by interrupting contiguous stretches of hydrophobic residues in the primary sequence.},

	abstract = " Global measures of structural diversity within a distribution of biopolymers, such as the radius of gyration and percent native contacts, have proven useful in the analysis of simulation data for protein folding. In this paper we describe a statistical-based methodology to quantify the local structural variability of a distribution of biopolymers, applied to 46- and 69-{\grqq}residue‚Äù off-lattice, three-color model proteins. Each folds into Œ≤-barrel structures. First we perform a principal component analysis of all interbead distance variables for a large number of independent, converged Boltzmann-distributed samples of conformations collected at each of a wide range of temperatures. Next, the principal component vectors are subjected to orthogonal (varimax) rotation. The results are displayed on so-called {\grqq}squared-loading‚Äù plots. These provide a quantitative measure of the contribution to the sample variance of the position of each residue relative to the others. Dominant structural elements, those having the largest structural diversity within the sampled distribution, are responsible for peaks and shoulders observed in the specific heat versus temperature curves, generated using the weighted histogram analysis method. The loading plots indicate that the local-structural diversity of these systems changes gradually with temperature through the folding transition but radically changes near the collapse transition temperature. The analysis of the structural overlap order statistic suggests that the 46-mer thermodynamic folding transition involves the native state and at least three other nearly native intermediates. In the case of the 46-mer protein model, data are generated at sufficiently low temperatures that squared-loading plots, coupled with cluster analysis, provide a local and energetic description of its glassy state."

Approaches to the problem combine ideas from the physics of disordered systems, polymer physics, and molecular biology. Much can be learned from the statistical properties of model heteropolymers, the chain molecules having different monomers in irregular sequences. Even in highly evolved proteins, there is a strong random element in the sequences, which gives rise to a statistical ensemble of sequences for a given folded shape. Simple analytic models give rise to phase transitions between random, glassy, and folded states, depending on the temperature T and the design temperature Tdes of the ensemble of sequences. Besides considering the analytic results obtainable in a random-energy model and in the Flory mean-field model of polymers, the article reports on confirming numerical simulations. "

The most important feature of the algorithm, which makes explicit use of the second derivative matrix of the potential surface, is that it is able to "walk uphill" from the minimum on a potential surface to the transition state essentially automatically. The method is illustrated by application to a two dimensional model problem, to the vinylidene-acetylene rearrangement (H,C = C:\_HC=:CH), and to the dissociation and rearrangement of formaldehyde (H,CO\_H, + CO, HCOH). The algorithm is also seen to provide an improved way of following a reaction path from a transition state down to reactants or products. }

The method has been applied to model and ab initio test cases with encouraging results.

Ultimately this broad kinetic spectrum is determined by the amino acid sequences that define these proteins, suggesting that the mechanisms that underlie folding may be almost as complex as the sequences that encode them. Here, however, we summarize recent experimental results which suggest that (1) despite a vast diversity of structures and functions, there are fundamental similarities in the folding mechanisms of single domain proteins and (2) rather than being highly sensitive to the finest details of sequence, their folding kinetics are determined primarily by the large-scale, redundant features of sequence that determine a protein's gross structural properties. That folding kinetics can be predicted using simple, empirical, structure-based rules suggests that the fundamental physics underlying folding may be quite straightforward and that a general and quantitative theory of protein folding rates and mechanisms (as opposed to unfolding rates and thus protein stability) may be near on the horizon.

Recent technological developments have provided the tools to design and build scientific instruments of high enough sensitivity and precision to manipulate and visualize individual molecules and measure microscopic forces. Using SMEs it is possible to manipulate molecules one at a time and measure distributions describing molecular properties, characterize the kinetics of biomolecular reactions and detect molecular intermediates. SMEs provide additional information about thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular processes. This complements information obtained in traditional bulk assays. In SMEs it is also possible to measure small energies and detect large Brownian deviations in biomolecular reactions, thereby offering new methods and systems to scrutinize the basic foundations of statistical mechanics. This review is written at a very introductory level, emphasizing the importance of SMEs to scientists interested in knowing the common playground of ideas and the interdisciplinary topics accessible by these techniques. The review discusses SMEs from an experimental perspective, first exposing the most common experimental methodologies and later presenting various molecular systems where such techniques have been applied. I briefly discuss experimental techniques such as atomic-force microscopy (AFM), laser optical tweezers (LOTs), magnetic tweezers (MTs), biomembrane force probes (BFPs) and single-molecule fluorescence (SMF). I then present several applications of SME to the study of nucleic acids (DNA, RNA and DNA condensation) and proteins (protein--protein interactions, protein folding and molecular motors). Finally, I discuss applications of SMEs to the study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of small systems and the experimental verification of fluctuation theorems.

The energies of the conformational states of the protein are taken to be random variables. The degree of similarity of each state with the native is described by an order parameter œÅ. The energy is, on average, a decreasing function of œÅ, in line with the principle of minimal frustration. The limiting case model described here has global connectivity. There are no restrictions on the change in order parameter in the elementary moves through conformational space. The folding kinetics vary as a function of both the energy gap between the folded and unfolded states and the roughness of the energy landscape. This model yields curved Arrhenius plots that are qualitatively similar to those seen in experiments and in simulations of protein folding. We show that in globally connected models, the Laplace transformed concentrations of species obey a frequency dependent generalization of the law of mass action. We show that when states with intermediate degrees of ordering are included in a globally connected model, one obtains much the same qualitative behavior as some experiments that are often used to justify the existence of specific intermediates along a sequential pathway even though there is no such path in the model. Also we show that for short times, populations of ensembles of configurations are dominated by entropic considerations: an observation in harmony with studies on initial events in folding based on more detailed models. Thus, we believe that this model sheds light on the interpretation of experiments that probe protein folding kinetics "

	abstract = " Two-state models provide phenomenological descriptions of many different systems, ranging from physics to chemistry and biology. We investigate work fluctuations in an ensemble of two-state systems driven out of equilibrium under the action of an external perturbation. We calculate the probability density PN(W) that work equal to W is exerted upon the system (of size N) along a given non-equilibrium trajectory and introduce a trajectory thermodynamics formalism to quantify work fluctuations in the large-N limit. We then define a trajectory entropy SN(W) that counts the number of non-equilibrium trajectories PN(W) = exp(SN(W)/kBT) with work equal to W and characterizes fluctuations of work trajectories around the most probable value Wmp. A trajectory free energy can also be defined, which has a minimum at W = W‚Ä†, this being the value of the work that has to be efficiently sampled to quantitatively test the Jarzynski equality. Within this formalism a Lagrange multiplier is also introduced, the inverse of which plays the role of a trajectory temperature. Our general solution for PN(W) exactly satisfies the fluctuation theorem by Crooks and allows us to investigate heat fluctuations for a protocol that is invariant under time reversal. The heat distribution is then characterized by a Gaussian component (describing small and frequent heat exchange events) and exponential tails (describing the statistics of large deviations and rare events). For the latter, the width of the exponential tails is related to the aforementioned trajectory temperature. Finite-size effects to the large-N theory and the recovery of work distributions for finite N are also discussed. Finally, we pay particular attention to the case of magnetic nanoparticle systems under the action of a magnetic field H where work and heat fluctuations are predicted to be observable in ramping experiments in micro-SQUIDs.

The model consists of two levels (folded and unfolded states) separated by an intermediate barrier. We compute the probability distribution for the dissipated work and give analytical expressions for the average and variance of the distribution. To first order, the amount of dissipated work is directly proportional to the rate of application of force (the loading rate) and to the relaxation time of the molecule. The model yields estimates for parameters that characterize the unfolding kinetics under force in agreement with those obtained in recent experimental results. We obtain a general equation for the minimum number of repeated experiments needed to obtain an equilibrium free energy, to within k(B)T, from nonequilibrium experiments by using the Jarzynski formula. The number of irreversible experiments grows exponentially with the ratio of the average dissipated work, W(dis) to k(B)T.",

Single linear molecules can be still regarded as statistical systems, where the thermodynamic limit is represented by infinitely long chains. The question of equivalence between different ensembles is not at all obvious and has been addressed in the literature, with sometimes contradicting conclusions. We address this problem by studying the scaling properties of the ensemble difference for two different chain models as a function of the degree of polymerization. By characterizing the scaling behavior of the difference between the isotensional (Gibbs) and isometric (Helmholtz) ensembles in the transition from the low-stretching to the high-stretching regime, we show that ensemble equivalence cannot be reached for macroscopic chains in the low force regime, and we characterize the transition from the inequivalence to the equivalence regime.

	abstract = "Background Recent experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that protein folding kinetics can be quite complex and diverse depending on various factors such as size of the protein sequence and external conditions. For example, some proteins fold apparently in a kinetically two-state manner, whereas others follow complex routes to the native state. We have set out to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diverse behavior seen in the refolding kinetics of proteins in terms of properties that are intrinsic to the sequence.Results: The folding kinetics of a number of sequences for off-lattice continuum models of proteins is studied using Langevin simulations at two different values of the friction coefficient. We show for these models that there is a remarkable correlation between folding time, [tau]F, and [sigma]=(T[theta] - TF)/T[theta], where T[theta] and TF are the equilibrium collapse and folding transition temperatures, respectively. The microscopic dynamics reveals that several scenarios for the kinetics of refolding arise depending on the range of values of [sigma]. For relatively small [sigma], the chain reaches the native conformation by a direct native conformation nucleation collapse (NCNC) mechanism without being trapped in any detectable intermediates. For moderate and large values of [sigma], the kinetics is described by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, according to which a fraction of molecules [Phi] (kinetic partition factor) reach the native conformation via the NCNC mechanism. The remaining fraction attains the native state by off-pathway processes that involve trapping in several misfolded structures. The rate-determining step in the off-pathway processes is the transition from the misfolded structures to the native state. The partition factor [Phi] is also determined by [sigma]: the smaller the value of [sigma], the larger is [Phi]. The qualitative aspects of our results are found to be independent of the friction coefficient. The simulation results and theoretical arguments are used to obtain estimates for timescales for folding via the NCNC mechanism in small proteins, those with less than about 70 amino acid residues.Conclusions We have shown that the various scenarios for folding of proteins, and possibly other biomolecules, can be classified solely in terms of [sigma]. Proteins with small values of [sigma] reach the native conformation via a nucleation collapse mechanism and their energy landscape is characterized by having one dominant native basin of attraction (NBA). On the other hand, proteins with large [sigma] get trapped in competing basins of attraction (CBAs) in which they adopt misfolded structures. Only a small fraction of molecules access the native state rapidly when [sigma] is large. For these sequences, the majority of the molecules approach the native state by a three-stage multipathway mechanism in which the rate-determining step involves a transition from one of the CBAs to the NBA."

This approach extends the scope of the weighted histogram analysis method and is applied to the exploration of the balance of forces within the off-lattice Honeycutt--Thirumalai 46-mer beta-barrel model. Specificity is introduced into the long range hydrophobic interactions by scaling back the non-native attractive component of the hydrophobic interactions through a scaling factor Œª (0<Œª<1). Thermodynamic properties for incremental values of Œª are extrapolated from the sampling of the original (Œª = 1) Hamiltonian. The results were found to be in good agreement with the thermodynamic signatures obtained by direct simulations. Decreasing the strength of the non-native attractive hydrophobic interactions leads to a more cooperative folding with the folding and collapse temperatures nearly coinciding at Œª = 0.0. The free energy surfaces were also seen to become progressively smoother while retaining a pronounced native well. Thus, this methodology may be used in the development, refinement, and exploration of folding for off-lattice protein models. ¬© 1998 American Institute of Physics.",

Instead it turns into an amorphous glassy state below 200 K. Extending the temperature range facilitates the spectral separation of different molecular processes. The conformational motions of proteins show an abrupt enhancement near 180 K, which has been called a {\grqq}dynamical transition‚Äù. In this contribution various aspects of the transition are critically reviewed: the role of the instrumental resolution function in extracting displacements from neutron elastic scattering data and the question of the appropriate dynamic model, discrete transitions between states of different energy versus continuous diffusion inside a harmonic well, are discussed. A decomposition of the transition involving two motional components is performed: rotational transitions of methyl groups and small scale librations of side-chains, induced by water at the protein surface. Both processes create an enhancement of the observed amplitude. The onset occurs, when their time scale becomes compatible with the resolution of the spectrometer. The reorientational rate of hydration water follows a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence, a characteristic feature of a dynamical transition. It occurs only with hydrated proteins, while the torsional motion of methyl groups takes place also in the dehydrated or solvent-vitrified system. Finally, the role of fast hydrogen bond fluctuations contributing to the amplitude enhancement is discussed. "

This G≈ç-type model exhibited thermodynamic and kinetic signatures of a well-designed two-state folder with concurrent collapse and folding transitions and single exponential kinetics at the transition temperature. Topological frustration is determined in the absence of energetic frustration by the distribution of Fersht œÜ values. Topologically unfrustrated systems present a unimodal distribution sharply peaked at intermediate œÜ, whereas highly frustrated systems display a bimodal distribution peaked at low and high œÜ values. The distribution of œÜ values in protein A was determined both thermodynamically and kinetically. Both methods yielded a unimodal distribution centered at œÜ = 0.3 with tails extending to low and high œÜ values, indicating the presence of a small amount of topological frustration. The contacts with high œÜ values were located in the turn regions between helices I and II and II and III, intimating that these hairpins are in large part required in the transition state. Our results are in good agreement with all-atom simulations of protein A, as well as lattice simulations of a three- letter code 27-mer (which can be compared with a 60-residue helical protein). The relatively broad unimodal distribution of œÜ values obtained from the all-atom simulations and that from the minimalist model for the same native fold suggest that the structure of the transition state ensemble is determined mostly by the protein topology and not energetic frustration.",

	abstract = " We report a computer-simulation study of the rate of homogeneous crystal nucleation and the structure of crystal nuclei in a Lennard-Jones system at moderate undercooling. The height of the nucleation barrier has been determined using umbrella sampling, whereas the barrier crossing rate is calculated using molecular dynamics simulation. The Simulations clearly show that the barrier crossing is a diffusive process. Nevertheless, the kinetic prefactor in the nucleation rate is found to be some two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by classical nucleation theory. The height of the barrier is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction. Although the Lennard-Jones system has a stable face-centered cubic (fee) phase below the melting line, the precritical nuclei are found to be mainly body-centered cubic (bcc) ordered. As they grow to their critical size, they become more fee ordered in the core. However, the critical and postcritical nuclei retain a high degree of bcc ordering in the interface. Furthermore it is found that in the interface the density falls off faster than the structural order parameter, which is in agreement with the predictions of density functional calculations. "

This helps us to interpret the Landau free energy calculations and to comment upon the suitability of the various order parameters for the cluster melting process. Systematic quenching offers us further insight into melting events for the 55-atom cluster.

	abstract = " The factors responsible for fast folding and stable 2D lattice proteins are studied by Monte Carlo kinetic simulations and by full enumeration. For weak effective coupling between residues ( i.e., high temperatures) the folding time is mainly controlled by the free energy gradient. When this coupling is strong, entrapment in local minima plays a major role. The energy gap separating the native state from the remaining conformations shows some correlation to the folding and unfolding times for a variety of sequences. These concepts are related to the ratio Tf/Tg proposed by Bryngelson and Wolynes. One source of local minima are strong, non‚Äênative (hindering) contacts. An exclusive increase in hindering contacts shows a strong correlation between the energy gap and the folding/unfolding times. Other local minima results from several native contacts that, if formed prematurely, interfere with the formation of others. To study these factors, we use a semispecific model characterized by attractive interactions between similar residues. A procedure to design stabler sequences with smoother landscapes is discussed. By comparing this model to the hydrophobic HP model, we show how higher potential heterogeneity can be used to improve folding. "

The topological requirement that P cannot intersect any of the chains of G is taken into account by a rigorous procedure: The only motions allowed for the chain are associated with the displacement of certain {\grqq}defects‚Äù along the chain. The main conclusions derived from this model are the following: (a) There are two characteristic times for the chain motion: One of them (Td) is the equilibration time for the defect concentration, and is proportional to M2. The other time (Tr) is the time required for complete renewal of the chain conformation, and is proportional to M3. (b) The over‚Äêall mobility and diffusion coefficients of the chain P are proportional to M‚àí2. (c) At times t < Tr the mean square displacement of one monomer of P increases only like „Äà(rt ‚àí r0)2„Äâ = constt1/4. These results may also turn out to be useful for the (more difficult) problem of entanglement effects in unlinked molten polymers. "

The polymers are 27 monomers long and consist of two monomer types. Although these chains are too long for exhaustive enumeration of all conformations, it is possible to enumerate all the maximally compact conformations, which are 3 √ó3√ó3 cubes. This allows us to select sequences that have a unique global minimum. We then explore the kinetics of collapse and folding and examine what features determine the various rates. The folding time has a plateau over a broad range of temperatures and diverges at both high and low temperatures. The folding time depends on sequence and is related to the amount of energetic frustration in the native state. The collapse times of the chains are sequence independent and are a few orders of magnitude faster than the folding times, indicating a two‚Äêphase folding process. Below a certain temperature the chains exhibit glasslike behavior, characterized by a slowing down of time scales and loss of self‚Äêaveraging behavior. We explicitly define the glass transition temperature (Tg), and by comparing it to the folding temperature (Tf), we find two classes of sequences: good folders with Tf‚â≥Tg and non‚Äêfolders with Tf<Tg.

Our modification of the standard GA method involves a coarse local minimization of each member of the population at every generation, as well as including the gradient into the fitness function. For Lennard-Jones (Ar)(n) clusters with n<30, the DS-GA converges far more quickly to the global minimum than either conventional GA methods or random search procedures. An application of this DS-GA is made to heterogeneous clusters of B(P-2) with multiple Ar atoms. The interaction potential is given by the lowest state of a 3X3 electronic Hamiltonian. The Ar-Ar potential and the lower energy (IT state) B-Ar potential are very similar. In contrast, the higher energy (Sigma state) B-Ar interaction is essentially repulsive. Consequently, the B atom is nearly always found to substitute for one of the atoms in the corresponding (Ar)(n+1) cluster with the fewest number of nearest neighbors.

Phys. 104, 2684 (1996)] proposed a global geometry optimization technique using a modified Genetic Algorithm approach for clusters. They refer to their technique as a deterministic/stochastic genetic algorithm (DS-GA). In this technique, the stochastic part is a traditional GA, with the manipulations being carried out on binary-coded internal coordinates (atom-atom distances). The deterministic aspect of their method is the inclusion of a coarse gradient descent calculation on each geometry. This step avoids spending a large amount of computer time searching parts of the configuration space which correspond to high-energy geometries. Their tests of the technique show it is vastly more efficient than searches without this local minimization. They report geometries for clusters of up to n = 29 Ar atoms, and find that their computer time scales as O(n(4.5)). In this work, we have recast the genetic algorithm optimization in space-fixed Cartesian coordinates, which scale much more favorably than internal coordinates for large clusters. We introduce genetic operators suited for real (base-10) variables. We find convergence for clusters up to n = 55. Furthermore, our algorithm scales as O(n(3.3)). It is concluded that genetic algorithm optimization in nonseparable real variables is not only viable, but numerically superior to that in internal candidates for atomic cluster calculations. Furthermore, no special choice of variable need be made for different cluster types; real Cartesian variables are readily portable, and can be used for atomic and molecular clusters with no extra effort.

In comparing a cusp catastrophe with the thermodynamics of phase transitions, the comaprison should be limited to those systems which clearly satisfy mean field theories and display a well defined spinodal; hydrogen-in-metal systems provide the best {\'e}xperimental examples, found so far, of such systems."

The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width (n atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n=‚àû an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies (¬±J,¬±J‚Ä≤) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2J/kTc) sinh(2J‚Ä≤/kTc)=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as -log |T-Tc|. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2J/kT) tanh(2J‚Ä≤/kT))n. }

These simulated mutations are analyzed in terms of various kinetic and thermodynamic changes with respect to wild type, but in addition we evaluate the structure-activity relationship of our model protein based on the œÜ-value calculated from both the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. We find that the simulated thermodynamic œÜ-values reproduce the experimental trends in the mutations studied and allow us to circumvent the difficult interpretation of the complicated kinetics of our model. Furthermore, the level of resolution of the model allows us to directly predict what experiments seek in regard to protein engineering studies of protein folding - namely the residues or portions of the polypeptide chain that contribute to the crucial step in the folding of the wild-type protein.

The thermodynamics of the folding process for this model are characterized using the multiple multihistogram method combined with constant-temperature Langevin simulations. The folding is shown to be highly cooperative, with chain collapse nearly accompanying folding. Two parallel folding pathways are shown to exist on the folding free energy landscape. One pathway contains an intermediate - similar to experiments on protein G, and one pathway contains no intermediates - similar to experiments on protein L. The folding kinetics are characterized by tabulating mean-first passage times, and we show that the onset of glasslike kinetics occurs at much lower temperatures than the folding temperature. This model is expected to be useful in many future contexts: investigating questions of the role of local versus nonlocal interactions in various fold classes, addressing the effect of sequence mutations affecting secondary structure propensities, and providing a computationally feasible model for studying the role of solvation forces in protein folding.

In contrast, the energy landscape theory of folding considers folding as the progressive organization of an ensemble of partially folded structures through which the protein passes on its way to the natively folded structure. As a result of evolution, proteins have a rugged funnel-like landscape biased toward the native structure. Connecting theory and simulations of minimalist models with experiments has completely revolutionized our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control protein folding."

A theoretical model is developed to explain these results based on the Wulff construction modified to include twin-boundaries. In addition to reproducing the re-entrant surfaces, the theory suggests that the total surface energy of the decahedral form is sandwiched between those of a single crystal and an icosahedral MTP. Consequently the stability of the decahedral particles (in a certain size range) relative to single crystals can now be explained. A useful perturbation modification is also outlined which enables qualitative comparisons of the surface energies to be made, and shows that the twin boundaries in MTPs limit the possible surface facets. Explicit shapes and energies are presented for two extreme models of the faceting. Finally, a model is outlined to justify the difference between the structures reported here and the more common decahedra and Icosahedra‚Äîthe standard forms are artefacts of the growth process; they are not the thermodynamically most stable structures.

The rate of kinetic energy equipartitioning is examined for GPP dynamics using a generalization of the ergodic measure and found to be significantly faster than for standard molecular dynamics simulation. A global optimization algorithm is developed based on simulated annealing of the phase space density distribution.

The phase transition is a random first-order phase transition where the supercooled-liquid phase is composed of glassy clusters separated by interfaces or domain walls. Because of entropic driving forces the glassy clusters are continually being created and destroyed. As the ideal transition temperature is approached the entropic driving force vanishes and the size of the glassy clusters diverges with an exponent of ŒΩ=2/d. All long-time dynamical processes are activated and the Vogel-Fulcher law is obtained for the liquid-state relaxation time. "

We observe that a significant fraction of the curvatures become negative in the region sampled by the system at temperatures even as low as one‚Äêfourth the melting temperature. Further, the curvature distribution changes dramatically with respect to temperature at the melting point. We also construct and evaluate a new distribution for the distance between the atoms in their instantaneous dynamical configurations and those in their corresponding ‚Äò‚Äòquenched‚Äô‚Äô configuration (i.e., the configuration found at the corresponding potential‚Äêenergy minimum).

Such classifications have been constructed for several starting configurations in the solid, fluid, and coexistence phases of the two-dimensional Gaussian core model. These quenches reveal a remarkable degree of polycrystalline order hidden within the fluid phase by "vibrational" distortion, and that order appears to have a large correlation length. The results suggest that melting hinges upon defect softening in the quenched packings, and a crude "theory" of melting for the Gaussian core model is developed in the Appendix. }

We explore the physical mechanism for the action of such gatekeepers, in the form of salt-bridgelike charged residues, on the early folding behavior of a model 46-mer Œ≤-barrel protein. Computer simulations employing Langevin dynamics show that the gatekeepers enhance the kinetics of folding on time scales that are about three orders of magnitude shorter than previously reported folding times for this model system. Analysis of the unfolded ensembles of the wild type (WT) Œ≤-barrel and several good and poor salt bridge designs indicates that the proteins with well designed salt-bridge gatekeepers favor productive folding routes when compared to the WT system. The conclusions of our theoretical observations are in agreement with experimental studies of the ribosomal protein S6 and its mutants. "

Here we perform a theoretical survey of proteins of known native structure and map out the landscape of possible dynamical behaviours under stretching at constant speed. We consider 7510 proteins comprising not more than 150 amino acids and 239 longer proteins. The model used is constructed based on the native geometry. It is solved by methods of molecular dynamics and validated by comparing the theoretical predictions to experimental results. We characterize the distribution of peak forces and investigate correlations with the system size and with the structure classification as characterized by the CATH scheme. Despite the presence of such correlations, proteins with the same CATH index may belong to different classes of dynamical behaviour. We identify proteins with the biggest forces and show that they belong to few topology classes. We determine which protein segments act as mechanical clamps and show that, in most cases, they correspond to long stretches of parallel Œ≤-strands, but other mechanisms are also possible.",

The titin molecule consists largely of tandem domains of the immuno-globulin and fibronectin-III types, together with specialized binding regions and a putative elastic region, the PEVK domain [3]. We have done mechanical experiments on single molecules of titin to determine their visco-elastic properties, using an optical-tweezers technique. On a fast (0.ls) timescale titin is elastic and force--extension data can be fitted with standard random-coil polymer models, showing that there are two main sources of elasticity: one deriving from the entropy of straightening the molecule; the other consistent with extension of the polypeptide chain in the PEVK region. On a slower timescale and above a certain force threshold, the molecule displays stress-relaxation, which occurs in rapid steps of a few piconewtons, corresponding to yielding of internal structures by about 20 nm. This stress-relaxation probably derives from unfolding of immu-noglobulin and fibronectin domains. Trinick, J. Cytoskeleton: titin as a scaffold and spring. Curr. Biol. 6, 258--260 (1996).

	abstract = {Familiar concepts for small molecules may require reinterpretation for larger systems. For example, rearrangements between geometrical isomers are usually considered in terms of transitions between the corresponding local minima on the underlying potential energy surface, V. However, transitions between bulk phases such as solid and liquid, or between the denatured and native states of a protein, are normally addressed in terms of free energy minima. To reestablish a connection with the potential energy surface we must think in terms of representative samples of local minima of V, from which a free energy surface is projected by averaging over most of the coordinates. The present contribution outlines how this connection can be developed into a tool for quantitative calculations. In particular, stepping between the local minima of V provides powerful methods for locating the global potential energy minimum, and for calculating global thermodynamic properties. When the transition states that link local minima are also sampled we can exploit statistical rate theory to obtain insight into global dynamics and rare events. Visualizing the potential energy landscape helps to explain how the network of local minima and transition states determines properties such as heat capacity features, which signify transitions between free energy minima. The organization of the landscape also reveals how certain systems can reliably locate particular structures on the experimental time scale from among an exponentially large number of local minima. Such directed searches not only enable proteins to overcome Levinthal's paradox but may also underlie the formation of "magic numbers" in molecular beams, the self-assembly of macromolecular structures, and crystallization.},

The conclusion is that the most powerful formulation of principal coordinate analyses for understanding protein folding and, in general, topographies of complex potentials, uses the changes in the set of interparticle distances as the definition of the comparison vector.

We then derive analytical formulae for the number of stationary points as a function of both system size and the Hessian index, using a framework based upon weakly interacting subsystems. This analysis reveals a simple relation between the total number of stationary points, the number of local minima, and the number of transition states connected on average to each minimum. Finally we calculate two measures of localization for the displacements corresponding to Hessian eigenvectors in samples of stationary points obtained from the Newton--Raphson-based geometry optimization scheme. Systematic differences are found between the properties of eigenvectors corresponding to positive and negative Hessian eigenvalues, and localized character is most pronounced for stationary points with low values of the Hessian index.

In this method, the potential energy surface of the system, which contains a large number of minima, is deformed (the deformation parameter being analogous to ``time{''}) in such a way that the number of minima is decreased dramatically. The deformation is carried out by finding a solution F of the diffusion equation for some time t, with the original potential function f as the boundary condition. In the present calculations, the atoms are assumed to interact by means of a Lennard-Jones potential, with parameters pertaining to argon; however, the results can easily be rescaled to any other Lennard-Jones parameters. The Lennard-Jones potential was fitted by a linear combination of Gaussians, so chosen to reproduce the potential accurately at physically relevant distances in clusters. The choice of Gaussians as fitting functions allowed F to be determined analytically. Further, by enforcing certain constraints on the Gaussian approximation of f, the following desirable behavior of F was guaranteed: at sufficiently large (known) time, the interaction potential is purely attractive so that the minimum of F can easily be recognized as the only existing one; it corresponds to a collapsed configuration (i.e., one with all atoms occupying the same position in space). Subsequent local minimizations for gradually decreasing times (the so-called time-reversing procedure) led rapidly to the global minimum of the original function. The resulting cluster configuration did not depend on the number of reversing time steps when this number was sufficiently large (approximately 100). The method was applied to several systems of up to m = 55 atoms and successfully found the global minimum, even in the largest of these (the 55-atom system, which involves minimization in the space of dimension 3m - 6 = 159 for a function having about 10(45) local minima).}",

This method has been designed to exploit the features that recent work suggests must be present in an energy landscape for efficient relaxation to the global minimum. The transformation associates any point in configuration space with the local minimum obtained by a geometry optimization started from that point, effectively removing transition state regions from the problem. However, unlike other methods based upon hypersurface deformation, this transformation does not change the global minimum. The lowest known structures are located for all Lennard-Jones clusters up to 110 atoms, including a number that have never been found before in unbiased searches. ",

To test the algorithm, a standard suite of functions is given, as well as the energies and geometric structures of Lennard-Jones clusters, demonstrating the extreme efficiency of the method. Significant improvement over previous methods for high-dimensional systems is shown.}",

We were unable to identify any true double- or correlated-jump mechanisms in either mono- or divacancy structures. The low migration energies of interstitial defects are balanced by high formation energies which preclude them from contributing significantly to diffusion rates. Calculations based upon cells containing only 100 atoms have been criticised because of the unrealistically high effective defect concentrations when compared with a real solid at the melting point. We compare results for cells containing 256 and 500 atoms and conclude that our calculated stationary points are actually quite well converged."

Systematic differences between the atomic Lennard-Jones clusters and the C-60 molecular clusters are explained in terms of the effective pair potential; e.g., rearrangements of (C-60)(5)5 are generally localized because the potential is relatively short ranged.

Both inhibitors are members of the serpin family and both exist in the plasma in latent or inactive forms. We show here that the reactive centre of the serpins can adopt varying conformations and that mobility of the reactive centre is necessary for the function of antithrombin and its binding and activation by heparin; the identification of a new locked conformation explains the latent inactive state of PAI-1. This ability to vary conformation not only allows the modulation of inhibitory activity but also protects the circulating inhibitor against proteolytic attack. Together these findings explain the retention by the serpins of a large and unconstrained reactive centre as compared to the small fixed peptide loop of other families of serine protease inhibitors.}",

Until now, the only deterministic procedure designed to find the lowest-energy structures of such clusters was the diffusion equation method, which performed well for large clusters but sometimes failed for smaller ones. In the present paper we propose the so-called shift method (also deterministic), which deforms the original potential energy hypersurface by shifting the atom-atom Lennard-Jones potential. As a result, the whole system collapses into a single point. Then, by using the reversing procedure, the original potential is gradually restored while optimizing the structure for each step. This results in a kind of big bang, because the atoms emerge from the collapse point and the cluster geometry evolves to the final one corresponding to the original undeformed potential. The procedure applied to the clusters containing up to 19 atoms turned out to produce in all cases under study the structures of the lowest energy.}",

	Abstract = "{In the classical molecular dynamics for a complicated system the trajectory remains relatively close to any arbitrarily chosen starting configuration of the nuclei. This is because of a prohibitively large volume of the configurational space as well as of energy barriers between numerous potential energy basins. In the present paper the molecular dynamics is performed on a deformed potential energy hypersurface. The deformation is tunable, and when increased, the barriers become lower or even disappear; therefore, the system is able to explore much larger regions of the configurational space. The deformation is slowly released, and finally the molecular dynamics is continued on the undeformed potential energy hypersurface. As a result of such a procedure, some low-energy structures may be found in a more effective way. The method has been applied to the clusters of the N Lennard-Jones atoms, N = 5,..., 66, which is the most extensive systematic study of the clusters published till now. The energies of the clusters are lower than those obtained by the classical molecular dynamics (at the same numerical effort) for the starting points being far away from the lowest energy region. Contrary to the molecular dynamics, they are independent of the starting point to a significant degree. The size of the most stable cluster turned out to be a stepwise increasing function of N, which reflects building of new atomic shells. However, for N = 38 some qualitative change of the structure to the one characteristic for the infinite crystal occurs and the cluster size becomes abnormally low when compared to the clusters with N < 38 and N > 38.y}",

The Gaussian density annealing (GDA) approach of Ma and Straub {[}J. Chem. Phys 101, 533 (1994)] provides a set of equations of motion for Gaussian widths and centers. These equations are used to anneal the system from high temperature, with large Gaussian widths describing the particle density distribution, to low temperature. In order to ensure a quasiequilibrium throughout this process, certain constraints are imposed during the annealing. The results of structure optimization of van der Waals clusters using different variants of the GDA are compared. These applications demonstrate the advantage and efficiency of our method, a variation of the GDA algorithm, which anneals on consecutive levels of lower temperature. Extensions of the approach for atomic systems to include rigorous bond constraints in molecular clusters are also presented. Water cluster structures are investigated and compared with other theoretical calculations. Our findings suggest that the nature of the underlying free energy surface may diminish the efficacy of the GDA, and related methods, in locating global minima for clusters.}",

The second approach, called the `'nearest neighbor pivot method,'' chooses the pivot probes to be the nearest neighbor points in the phase space. We examine the choice of distribution by comparing the efficiency of the methods for Gaussian versus generalized q-distribution, based on the Tsallis entropy in the relocation of the probes. The two implementations of the method are tested with a series of test functions and with several Lennard-Jones clusters of various sizes.

The problem of how a denatured protein re-folds to its active state (Levinthal's paradox(1)) has been addressed in terms of the underlying energy landscape(2-7), as has the widely used `strong' and `fragile' classification of liquids(8-9) Here we show how three archetypal energy landscapes for clusters of atoms or molecules can be characterized in terms of the disconnectivity graphs(10) of their energy minima-that is, in terms of the pathways that connect minima at different threshold energies. First we consider a cluster of 38 Lennard-Jones particles, whose energy landscape is a `double funnel' on which relaxation to the global minimum is diverted into a set of competing structures. Then we characterize the energy landscape associated with the annealing of C-60 cages to buckministerfullerene, and show that it provides experimentally accessible clues to the relaxation pathway. Finally we show a very different landscape morphology, that of a model water cluster (H2O)(20), and show how it exhibits features expected for a `strong' liquid. These three examples do not exhaust the possibilities, and might constitute substructures of still more complex landscapes.}",

Two low energy degenerate rearrangements are identified for the chiral cyclic global minimum which are analogous to processes that lead to observable tunneling splittings in the water trimer. Fourteen different pathways are characterized by ab initio calculations employing basis sets up to double‚Äêzeta plus polarization (DZP) quality with subsequent reoptimization of the associated minima using the Becke exchange and the Lee--Yang--Parr correlation functionals (BLYP) with the same basis. All the pathways have been recomputed for a number of different empirical potentials, some of which reproduce the two lowest energy degenerate rearrangements quite well. However, none of the empirical potentials support all the higher energy ab initio minima. Qualitative estimates of the two tunneling splittings associated with the lowest energy pathways suggest that at least one might be observable experimentally; the associated splitting patterns and nuclear spin weights are also reported. The corresponding stationary points were finally reoptimized using DZP basis sets plus diffuse functions with the BLYP exchange‚Äêcorrelation functional. "

Although molecular-level experiments have enabled sampling of individual ligand-receptor complex dissociation events, disparities in measured unbinding force F(R) among these methods lead to marked variation in inferred binding energetics and kinetics at equilibrium. These discrepancies are documented for even the ubiquitous ligand-receptor pair, biotin-streptavidin. We investigated these disparities and examined atomic-level unbinding trajectories via steered molecular dynamics simulations, as well as via molecular force spectroscopy experiments on biotin-streptavidin. In addition to the well-known loading rate dependence of F(R) predicted by Bell's model, we find that experimentally accessible parameters such as the effective stiffness of the force transducer k can significantly perturb the energy landscape and the apparent unbinding force of the complex for sufficiently stiff force transducers. Additionally, at least 20\% variation in unbinding force can be attributed to minute differences in initial atomic positions among energetically and structurally comparable complexes. For force transducers typical of molecular force spectroscopy experiments and atomistic simulations, this energy barrier perturbation results in extrapolated energetic and kinetic parameters of the complex that depend strongly on k. We present a model that explicitly includes the effect of k on apparent unbinding force of the ligand-receptor complex, and demonstrate that this correction enables prediction of unbinding distances and dissociation rates that are decoupled from the stiffness of actual or simulated molecular linkers.",

The examples we consider are a two-dimensional model energy surface and binary Lennard-Jones liquids and solids. A shortcoming of the mapping is its failure to divide the potential energy surface into basins of attraction surrounding saddle points, because there are many minima of ‚à£‚àáE‚à£2 that do not correspond to stationary points of the potential energy. In fact, most liquid configurations are mapped to such points for the system we consider. We therefore develop an alternative route to investigate higher-index saddle points and obtain near complete distributions of saddles for small Lennard-Jones clusters. The distribution of the number of stationary points as a function of the index is found to be Gaussian, and the average energy increases linearly with saddle point index in agreement with previous results for bulk systems "

In the author's view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropy theory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in {\grqq}viscous‚Äù liquids (shear relaxation time ‚â•10‚àí9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.

Here we demonstrate this latter contribution by illustrating the reach of some theoretical findings using a solvable but nontrivial molecular model whose properties are analogous to those of the corresponding experimental systems. In particular, we show the relationship between the thermodynamic and the mechanical properties of a protein. The simulations presented here also illustrate how forced and spontaneous unfolding occur through different pathways and that folding and unfolding rates at equilibrium cannot in general be obtained from forced unfolding experiments or simulations. We also study the relationship between the energy surface and the mechanical resistance of a protein and show how a simple analysis of the native state can predict much of the mechanical properties of a protein.",

	abstract = {The equilibrium free energy difference between two long-lived molecular species or "conformational states" of a protein (or any other molecule) can in principle be estimated by measuring the work needed to shuttle the system between them, independent of the irreversibility of the process. This is the meaning of the Jarzynski equality (JE), which we test in this paper by performing simulations that unfold a protein by pulling two atoms apart. Pulling is performed fast relative to the relaxation time of the molecule and is thus far from equilibrium. Choosing a simple protein model for which we can independently compute its equilibrium properties, we show that the free energy can be exactly and effectively estimated from nonequilibrium simulations. To do so, one must carefully and correctly determine the ensemble of states that are pulled, which is more important the farther from equilibrium one performs simulations; this highlights a potential problem in using the JE to extract the free energy from forced unfolding experiments. The results presented here also demonstrate that the free energy difference between the native and denatured states of a protein measured in solution is not always equal to the free energy profile that can be estimated from forced unfolding simulations (or experiments) using the JE.},

Variation of the applied force results in a modulation of the free-energy barrier to unfolding and thus, the rate of the process, which is often assumed to have single exponential kinetics. It has been recently shown that it is experimentally feasible, through the use of force clamps, to estimate the distribution of unfolding times for a population of proteins initially in the native state. In this Letter we show how the analysis of such distributions under a range of forces can provide unique information about the underlying free-energy surface such as the height of the free-energy barrier, the preexponential factor and the force dependence of the unfolding kinetics without resorting to ad hoc kinetic models.

We show that as the two ends of a protein, filamin, are pulled apart at a speed tending to zero, the measured mechanical strength plateaus at ‚àº30 pN instead of going toward zero, deviating from the Bell model. The deviation can only be explained by a switch between parallel pathways.

Furthermore, the elastic response of macromolecules to an applied force is the foundation of the single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques. The two main classes of models describing chain elasticity include the worm-like and freely jointed chain models. The selection between these two classes of models is based on the assumptions about chain flexibility. In many experimental situations, the choice is not clear, and a model describing the crossover between these two limiting classes is therefore in high demand. We are proposing a unified chain deformation model that describes the force‚àídeformation curve in terms of the chain bending constant, K, and bond length, b. This model demonstrates that the worm-like and freely jointed chain models correspond to two different regimes of polymer deformation, and the crossover between these two regimes depends on the chain bending rigidity and the magnitude of the applied force. Polymer chains with bending constant K > 1 behave as a worm-like chain under tension in the interval of the applied forces f ‚â§ KkBT/b and as a freely jointed chain for f ‚â• KkBT/b. (kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature.) The proposed crossover expression for chain deformation is in excellent agreement with the results of the molecular dynamics simulations of chain deformation and single-molecule deformation experiments of biological and synthetic macromolecules.

Significant advances in theory and experiments have resulted in a conceptual framework for describing the folding mechanisms of globular proteins. The sizes of proteins in the denatured and folded states, cooperativity of the folding transition, dispersions in the melting temperatures at the residue level, and timescales of folding are, to a large extent, determined by N, the number of residues. The intricate details of folding as a function of denaturant concentration can be predicted by using a novel coarse-grained molecular transfer model. By watching one molecule fold at a time, using single-molecule methods, investigators have established the validity of the theoretically anticipated heterogeneity in the folding routes and the N-dependent timescales for the three stages in the approach to the native state. Despite the successes of theory, of which only a few examples are documented here, we conclude that much remains to be done to solve the protein folding problem in the broadest sense. "

In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out with umbrella sampling and self-consistent histogram methods to determine free-energy profiles for a coarse-grained model of a protein under an applied force. Applied force is shown to cause fold catastrophes, where free-energy minima are destabilized until they disappear. It is well-known that a fold catastrophe at force f = B implies the scaling ŒîGb ‚âà |B ‚àí f|3/2 in the limit of ŒîGb ‚Üí 0, but it is not clear whether this scaling is accurate for physically relevant barrier heights. The simulation results show that the fold catastrophe scaling is in fact accurate in the physically relevant regime and that the two-parameter function ŒîGb = A(B ‚àí f)3/2 is superior to the two-parameter linear function for parametrizing changes in free-energy barriers with applied force.

The main observable in such experiments is the distribution of the forces, at which the escape events occur. The challenge in interpreting the experimental data is to relate them to the microscopic system properties. We work out a maximum likelihood approach and show that it is the optimal method to tackle this problem. When fitting actual experimental data it is unavoidable to assume some functional form for the force-dependent escape rate. Focusing on escape processes over a single activation barrier, we consider a quite general and common such functional form and demonstrate by means of data from a realistic computer experiment that the maximum number of fit parameters that can be determined reliably is three. They are related to the force-free escape rate and the position and height of the activation barrier. Furthermore, the results for the first two of these fit parameters show little dependence on the assumption about the manner in which the barrier decreases with the applied force, while the last one, the barrier height in the absence of force, depends strongly on this assumption."

A proposed mechanism for stretching titin, by sequential denaturation of individual fibronectin type III-immunoglobulin domains in response to applied tension, is analyzed here quantitatively. The folded domain is approximately 4 nm long, and the unraveled polypeptide can extend to 29 nm, providing a 7-fold stretch over the relaxed length. Elastic recoil is achieved by refolding of the denatured domains when the force is released. The critical force required to denature a domain is calculated to be 3.5-5 pN, based on a net free energy for denaturation of 7-14 kcal/mol, plus 5 kcal/mol to extend the polypeptide (1 cal = 4.184 J). This force is comparable to the 2- to 7-pN force generated by single myosin or kinesin molecules. The force needed to pull apart a noncovalent protein-protein interface is estimated here to be 10-30 pN, implying that titin will stretch internally before the molecule is pulled from its attachment at the Z band. Many extracellular matrix and cell adhesion molecules, such as fibronectin, contain tandem arrays of fibronectin type III domains. Both single molecules and matrix fibers should have elastic properties similar to titin "

The molecule unfolds in a high-force transition beginning at 20 to 30 piconewtons and refolds in a low-force transition at ‚àº2.5 piconewtons. A fraction of the molecule (5 to 40 percent) remains permanently unfolded, behaving as a wormlike chain with a persistence length (a measure of the chain‚Äôs bending rigidity) of 20 angstroms. Force hysteresis arises from a difference between the unfolding and refolding kinetics of the molecule relative to the stretch and release rates in the experiments, respectively. Scaling the molecular data up to sarcomeric dimensions reproduced many features of the passive force versus extension curve of muscle fibers."

The theory of reaction rates yields an equation for absolute viscosity applicable to cases involving activation energies where the usual theory of energy transfer does not apply. This equation reduces to a number of the successful empirical equations under the appropriate limiting conditions. The increase of viscosity with shearing stress is explained. The same theory yields an equation for the diffusion coefficient which when combined with the viscosity and applied to the results of Orr and Butler for the diffusion of heavy into light water gives a satisfactory and suggestive interpretation. The usual theories for diffusion coefficients and absolute electrical conductance should be replaced by those developed here when ion and solvent molecule are of about the same size "

A comparison of analytical results with Langevin simulations shows that the scaling relations for the barrier heights and most probable forces are more accurate in the case of active rebinding than for unbinding. Our consideration demonstrates that simultaneous analysis of probability density functions for unbinding and rebinding forces improves essentially the accuracy of retrieval information on intrinsic parameters of the molecular complex from the force measurements.

To investigate the extent of the topological control of the folding process, we studied the folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using a Go-like potential to retain the information about the native structures but drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among residue-residue native interactions. By comparing the structure of the transition state ensemble (experimentally determined by Phi-values) and of the intermediates with those obtained using our models, we show that these energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known features of the transition state ensembles and "en-route" intermediates, at least for the analyzed proteins. This result clearly indicates that, as long as the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated, topology plays a central role in determining the folding mechanism. }

One connectin molecule runs through the I band and binds onto the myosin filament up to the M line starting from the Z line. It positions the myosin filament at the center of a sarcomere. Connectin is also responsible for resting tension generation. Biodiversity of the connectin family exists in invertebrate muscle."

	abstract = "In addition to thick and thin filaments, vertebrate striated muscle contains a third filament system formed by the giant protein titin. Single titin molecules extend from Z discs to M lines and are longer than 1 micrometer. The titin filament contributes to muscle assembly and resting tension, but more details are not known because of the large size of the protein. The complete complementary DNA sequence of human cardiac titin was determined. The 82-kilobase complementary DNA predicts a 3-megadalton protein composed of 244 copies of immunoglobulin and fibronectin type III (FN3) domains. The architecture of sequences in the A band region of titin suggests why thick filament structure is conserved among vertebrates. In the I band region, comparison of titin sequences from muscles of different passive tension identifies two elements that correlate with tissue stiffness. This suggests that titin may act as two springs in series. The differential expression of the springs provides a molecular explanation for the diversity of sarcomere length and resting tension in vertebrate striated muscles.",

	abstract = " Titin, an important constituent of vertebrate muscles, is a protein of the order of a micrometer in length in the folded state. Atomic force microscopy and laser tweezer experiments have been used to stretch titin molecules to more than ten times their folded lengths. To explain the observed relation between force and extension, it has been suggested that the immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains unfold one at a time in an all-or-none fashion. We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the forced unfolding of two different fibronectin type 3 domains (the ninth,9Fn3, and the tenth,10Fn3, from human fibronectin) and of their heterodimer of known structure. An external biasing potential on the N to C distance is employed and the protein is treated in the polar hydrogen representation with an implicit solvation model. The latter provides an adiabatic solvent response, which is important for the nanosecond unfolding simulation method used here. A series of simulations is performed for each system to obtain meaningful results. The two different fibronectin domains are shown to unfold in the same way along two possible pathways. These involve the partial separation of the 'beta-sandwich', an essential structural element, and the unfolding of the individual sheets in a stepwise fashion. The biasing potential results are confirmed by constant force unfolding simulations. For the two connected domains, there is complete unfolding of one domain (9Fn3) before major unfolding of the second domain (10Fn3). Comparison of different models for the potential energy function demonstrates that the dominant cohesive element in both proteins is due to the attractive van der Waals interactions; electrostatic interactions play a structural role but appear to make only a small contribution to the stabilization of the domains, in agreement with other studies of [beta]-sheet stability. The unfolding forces found in the simulations are of the order of those observed experimentally, even though the speed of the former is more than six orders of magnitude greater than that used in the latter."

	abstract = " Titin I27 shows a high resistance to unfolding when subject to external force. To investigate the molecular basis of this mechanical stability, protein engineering [Phi]-value analysis has been combined with atomic force microscopy to investigate the structure of the barrier to forced unfolding. The results indicate that the transition state for forced unfolding is significantly structured, since highly destabilising mutations in the core do not affect the force required to unfold the protein. As has been shown before, mechanical strength lies in the region of the A' and G-strands but, contrary to previous suggestions, the results indicate clearly that side-chain interactions play a significant role in maintaining mechanical stability. Since [Phi]-values calculated from molecular dynamics simulations are the same as those determined experimentally, we can, with confidence, use the molecular dynamics simulations to analyse the structure of the transition state in detail, and are able to show loss of interactions between the A' and G-strands with associated A-B and E-F loops in the transition state. The key event is not a simple case of loss of hydrogen bonding interactions between the A' and G-strands alone. Comparison with [Phi]-values from traditional folding studies shows differences between the force and 'no-force' transition states but, nevertheless, the region important for kinetic stability is the same in both cases. This explains the correspondence between hierarchy of kinetic stability (measured in stopped-flow denaturant studies) and mechanical strength in these titin domains."

	abstract = " Molecular simulations are carried out on the Immunoglobulin 27 domain of the titin protein. The energy landscape is mapped out using an implicit solvent model, and molecular dynamics simulations are run with the solvent explicitly modeled. Stretching a protein is shown to produce a dynamic energy landscape in which the energy minima move in configuration space, change in depth, and are created and destroyed. The connections of these landscape changes to the mechanical unfolding of the Immunoglobulin 27 domain are addressed. Hydrogen bonds break upon stretching by either intrabasin processes associated with the movement of energy minima, or interbasin processes associated with transitions between energy minima. Intrabasin changes are reversible and dominate for flexible interactions, whereas interbasin changes are irreversible and dominate for stiff interactions. The most flexible interactions are Glu-Lys salt bridges, which can act like tethers to bind strands even after all backbone interactions between the strands have been broken. As the protein is stretched, different types of structures become the lowest energy structures, including structures that incorporate nonnative hydrogen bonds. Structures that have flat energy versus elongation profiles become the lowest energy structures at elongations of several Angstroms, and are associated with the unfolding intermediate state observed experimentally."

Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 8730] that the {\grqq}clamp‚Äù formed by the parallel strands in this domain represents an optimal topology maximizing the mechanical strength of cross-linked polymer chains. Here we use simulations to demonstrate that protein G IgG-binding domain III and ubiquitin, both exhibiting a parallel strand arrangement similar to that in I27 but otherwise having a distinctly different fold and not involved in an obvious load-bearing function, exhibit high resistance to mechanical unfolding. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we compute the potential of mean force as a function of the distance between the domains' C- and N-termini and use transition state theory to calculate the force-dependent rates of unfolding. We further predict the outcome of a hypothetical single-molecule AFM pulling experiment, in which one of the I27 domains in titin is replaced by one of the above two proteins. For typical AFM pulling rates, the predicted unfolding force is in the range 190‚àí220 pN for ubiquitin and 100‚àí150 pN for the IgG-binding domain. "
